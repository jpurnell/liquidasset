 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0562
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.7173. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine B is Ch. Haut Brion 1983               
  2.   tied for  2nd place    Wine C is Ch. Ducru Beaucaillou 1983        
  3.   tied for  2nd place    Wine D is Ch. Lanessan 1983                 
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine A is Ch. Gruaud-Larose 1983             

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  1.3500. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.7173

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  1.00 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:
 
  The goal was to serve four wines, in magnum portions &mdash; but poured from bottles &mdash;
  to see how chateau rankings coordinate with tasting notes. The wines were selected to represent
  the quality spectrum from first growth to unclassed growth (albeit one of our host's favorites 
  for long aging).
  
  In order of their general classification, the Haut Brion sells around $300, the Ducru about $100&ndash;
  $125, the Gruaud Larose in the same range and the Lanessan about $100. The wines all sell for about 
  10 times their retail prices in 1986, and have been in our host's cellar since that time.
    
  The wines were very, very close to each other, despite their disparity in price.         
  Their age appears to have brought these very different growths closer    
  together, and in particular, the Lanessan showed on a par with the        
  great Haut Brion. The numbers of wines tasted has nothing to do with      
  the degree of correlation. All the wines are drinking well, there is no hurry 
  to finish them now and no harm drinking them now. Contrary to our         
  normal practice, we tried to identify the wines. Two of the tasters       
  correctly identified all four wines, but disagreed on the ranking of the  
  Haut Brion. Both of those tasters agreed that A and C were the Ducru and 
  the Gruaud Larose which had more in common than B, the Haut Brion.         
  One taster thought that A, B and D were very elegant and somewhat similar 
  and C was more lively asnd interesting.
