<div class=body>Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):<br><br>    W = 0.1360<br><br>The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation is rather large, 0.5640. Most analysts would say that unless this probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly related.<br><br>We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group preference.<br>A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a perfect predictor of the group's preferences.<br>A 0.0 means no correlation, while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group. This is measured by the correlation R.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be significantly different.<br><br></div>
<div class=table>    1.        ........ 1st place        Wine D is 1983 Chateau Mouton Rothschild

</div>
<div class=body>We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering. The Friedman Chi-Square value is  2.040. The probability that this could happen by chance is  0.564.</div>
<div class=body>We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correlations that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.<br><br></div>
<div class=body>Pairwise Rank Correlations<br><br>Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.961 for significance at the 0.05 level, and must exceed  0.928 for significance at the 0.10 level.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>COMMENT:<br><br>Overall this was a marvelous opportunity to taste the 83 vintage from a cellar that they have remained undisturbed. The wines were all in great condition and a treat to drink. The evening started with an 89 Mersault from Jobard which was a beautiful mature white from Burgundy in the great tradition of old white burgundy.<br>The surprise in terms of over performance was the Lanessan which today is likely valued at well below that of its peers. <br>The star of the tasting was the Mouton </div>
