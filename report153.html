 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2887
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0236. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 16.1667. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0236

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The wines as whole were tremendous and the differences were secondary to  
  the overall pleasure that the group had from drinking them. There were       
  few if any full or partially full glasses left on the table.  Having said all that,    
  2003 was a clear winner in the tasting in both appellations. The design   
  of this winetasting was to permit  comparison of vineyards and vintages.We first
  note that the overall agreement in the group was very strong. The rank sums themselves 
  can be summed in two ways: over vintages and over appellations. Doing this the first way, 
  we get rank sums of 80, 82, 81 and 45 for 1990, 1995, 1999 and 2003 respectively. Doing it the other 
  way we get 153 for Clos de la Roche and 135 for Chambertin. While the difference in the 
  ranksums over appellations is not significant (although Chambertin edges out Clos de la Roche),
  and while the sum of rank sums for 1990, 1995 and 1999 are essentially identical, 2003 is 
  rated significantly better than the other three vintages (See Richard E. Quandt, <em>The Journal 
  of Wine Economics</em>, May 2007, pp. 98-102), which is further interesting because the 2003
  wines were marginally less expensive than the others. What is further convincing evidence that 
  the vintage effects are much more important than the appelllations effects is the the best two 
  wines include a Clos de la Roche and a Chambertin, while the worst two wines also include one of
  each appellation.    
                                      
  Overall the vintages to trump the vineyards.  The group felt that 2003s were a      
  surprise.
