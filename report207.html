 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1257
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.4246. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine G is Pierre Usseglio 2009

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  7.0417. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.4246

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This was a tasting of mature Ch&acirc;teauneuf du Pape; even though this did   
  not have all of the famous names, the wines were delicious to drink.       
  All of these wines were enjoyable. Given this, there was producer and     
  vintage variation; the wine that was most preferred  proves that a good   
  value can be found among the many wines of Ch&acirc;teauneuf du Pape.      
  The Clarendon Hills wasn't uniquely idenified.
