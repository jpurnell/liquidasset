 We now measure the amount of correlation (W) among the judges:                 
 W = 1.0 => perfect correlation, W = 0 => no correlation                        
<br>
 We also provide a probability measure that this correlation is due to chance   
<br>
 In this case the correlation is =     0.3707                                   
<br>
 Probability that correlation is due to chance = 0.0002                         
<br>
We compute the correlation of each taster with the average ranking of the oth-  
ers and with prices. 1.0 => perfect, 0 => none, -1.0 => total disagreement

  Comments:
  
  It is amazing that the two significant winners where both Rieslings made by Clemens Busch, a 
  small organic producer from Puenderich on the Middle Mosel.
  Even more amazing is that at two similar tastings many years ago both winner wines at both 
  tastings were Clemens Busch wines as well (see <a href="report6.html"> Report 6</a> and <a href="report12.html">Report 12</a>).
