     ( 5 is the best possible,  35 is the worst)
<br>
<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2829
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2046. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine F is Lambardi 2006                     
  2.   tied for  2nd place    Wine G is Collosorbo 2004                   
  3.   tied for  2nd place    Wine B is La Gerla Riserva gli Angeli 1999  
  4.   tied for  4th place    Wine A is Tenute la Fuga 1995               
  5.   tied for  4th place    Wine E is Castello Banfi 1999               
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine C is Frescobaldi Castelgiocondo 2004

  7.   ........  7th place    Wine D is Lisini 1997                       

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  8.4857. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.2046

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  During the tasting it seemed that the wines changed very little, an       
  unusual occurrence. they were all food-friendly, drinkable wines. They    
  were all mid-maturity drinkable wines. We noted that none of us was       
  familiar with the Lambardi, our top-ranked wine. The age of the wines seemed largely           
  unrelated to the group's preferences.
