 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3847
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0030. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 21.5417. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0030

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  These wines were all terrific and similar, but one wine had a technical   
  flaw that many of us felt indicated that it was corked. One taster felt   
  that if we had not known what these wines were, we would have identified  
  them as New World cabernets. In fact, three were cabernets, one was a     
  merlot, and the rest Bordeaux blends. We all agreed that these wines      
  will improve for a number of years. Note that in every tasting we have had
  in which Opus One was involved, it came in at or near the top. It is     
  interesting that our third favorite was Overture, which is the second wine
  of Opus One and non-vintage, available only at the chateau.
  
  This tasting also permits us to examine, at least partially, the judges'
  intertemporal consistency. A tasting on February 1, 2010 had five of the wines 
  in the present tasting. Their &quot;votes against&quot; and their overall ranks
  in the two tastings were as follows:
  
                     February 1, 2010       February 4, 2013
  Wine             Votes Against   Rank    Votes Against  Rank
  
  Twomey 2002           35          6            57        8
  Silver Oak 2003       29          3            18        1
  Opus One 2002         22          1            25        2
  Phelps Insignia 2005  30          4            36        4
  Dominus 2006          36          7            43        6 (tied)
  
  The votes are more tightly bunched in the February 2010 tasting, ranging from 22 to 36, 
  while in the 2013 tasting they range from 18 to 57. But the two tastings impose 
  essentially the same rank order among these five wines, which suggests a fairly significant
  temporal consistency in ranking these wines.
