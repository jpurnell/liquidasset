 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2753
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0310. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine G is 2001

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 15.4167. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0310

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  These were outstanding wines that exhibited substantial similarity to     
  one another, particularly in the nose. None of them was particularly    
  tannic and it is quite interesting that in spite of their similarity      
  one turned out to be statistically significantly good and one bad. The
  Insignia was drinking true to its character as a fine Bordeaux-like Napa
  Cabernet Sauvignon.  There was remarkable consistency across 8 vintages
  spanning 20 years. Soft tannins in the younger vintages (2007, 2013) make
  these very accessible and delicious.
  
  The varietal blend of these wines, stated on the label, tends to be mainly cabernet
  sauvignon, with the remainder tending to be merlot in the earlier years, but
  pedtit verdot, cabernet franc and even malbec in the later years.
         
  The overall correlation was 0.275, and the probability that this occurred 
  by chance was a mere 0.031, which is unusual for the group.The significance test
  for the ranksums of the four youngest wines vs. the ranksum of the older
  ones shows no significant difference.
