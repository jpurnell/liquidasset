     Group Ranking ->   8   6   2   4   5   7   1   3

     ( 8 is the best possible,  64 is the worst)
<br>
<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1838
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1726. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine G is Three Sticks 2016
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine C is Rhys 2015
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine H is Ojai Wineyard 2013
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine D is Pernand Vergeless 1999
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine E is Calvert 2012
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine B is Montebruno 2009
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine F is Sp&auml;tburgunder 2014
---------------------------------------------------
  8.   ........  8th place    Wine A is Ken Wright Cellars 2012

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 10.2917. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1726

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

                           Pairwise Rank Correlations

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This was a most interesting tasting of pinoit noirs assorted from a
  wide variety of sources. It is interesting that the tasters seem to have preferred the
  California Pinot Noirs to the others.
