 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1375
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.6990. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine C is Latricieres Chambertin (R-T) Gr, c
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine B is Gevrey Chambertin (R-T) 1er cru 20
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine A is Rossignol-Trapet Bourgogne 2005   
  4.   tied for  4th place    Wine D is Trinity Oaks Pinot Noir 2006 (Cali
  5.   tied for  4th place    Wine E is Talus Pinot Noir 2005 (France)    

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  2.2000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.6990
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is   0.9747. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.8000 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.90 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  There was very little agreement among the judges, as can be seen from the 
  Rank  Table. As a result, no wine was rated significantly good or         
  significantly bad. This is surprising in the light of the fact that the   
  price differences among the wines were enormous: the least expensive wine 
  (Talus) was a $6 wine, wheras the Latricieres Chambertin cost $135. The best
  a wine could have scored was a 4 and the worst it could have scored was a 20:
  in fact, no wine scored higher than 9 or lower than 14. But it should be said
  that the Latricieres Chambertin did have the best score.
