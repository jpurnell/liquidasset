 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2070
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2031. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   tied for  1st place    Wine D is Marbuzet 1983                     
  2.   tied for  1st place    Wine B is Clos Rene 1982                    
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine A is Baron Philippe 1983               
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine E is Baron Philippe 1982               
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine F is Clos Rene 1983                    
---------------------------------------------------
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine C is Marbuzet 1982                     

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  7.2449. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.2031

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Fact 1: tHE 83 Marbuzet and the 82 Clos Rene tied for first place. Fact 2:
  In the three possible com parisons, 83 beat 82;  2:1. B ut adding in the  
  last flight, the Gloria, it comes out 2:2. The comparison of 82 and 83    
  in Ch. Gloria mirrors for Ed the comparisons of most major chateaux in    
  the two vintages. The 82s are darker in color, slightly fuller in body,   
  more sensuous and less astringent than the high quality 83s. Bob says     
  that it is very close between 82 and 83. In the Gloria there is no        
  dispute that the 82 is superior. Bob is shocked at the rating of the 82   
  Marbuzet to the extent of wondering whether it might have been a bad      
  bottle.

 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.5102
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0588. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine B is Ch. Gloria 1982

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  3.5714. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0588

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  1.00 for significance at the 0.1 level
