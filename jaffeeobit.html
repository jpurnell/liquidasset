Dwight Jaffee, a long-time friend and former member of our wine group, died on January 28, 
2016 in San Fransisco. The cause was a recurrence of leukemia he had been battling for some 
time. When Dwight left Princeton to join the faculty at Berkeley’s Haas School of Business 
he could no longer attend our tastings but all of us were delighted by periodic guest 
appearances that affirmed his close connections to the group. He will be missed. A more 
complete obituary can be found at the <a href="http://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/article/mortgage-and-finance-">Berkeley obituary</a>.
