 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2980
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0640. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is Pride Mountain '97, Sonoma        
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine E is Peju '94, Napa                    
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine C is Chapellet '96, Napa               
  4.   tied for  4th place    Wine A is Thierry German, Marginale, '96    
  5.   tied for  4th place    Wine F is L'Ecosse '95, Napa

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 10.4286. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0640

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  These were all Cabernet Franc wines, and their prices all ranged between  
  $25 and $35. The l'Ecosse and the Stonefly may have been "underpriced"    
  because they were obtained directly from the vineyards.

 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.6327
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0119. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine A is Viader '97, Napa                  
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine C is L'Angelus '94                     
---------------------------------------------------
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine B is Cheval Blanc '94                 

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  8.8571. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0119

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  1.00 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The second flight of wines consisted of mixtures in which the Cabernet    
  Franc was mixed with Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot or Malbec. The          
  percentages were Viader: Cabernet Franc 38%, Cabernet Sauvignon 62%;      
  Cheval Blanc: Cabernet Franc 66%, Merlot 33%, Malbec 1%;, L'Angelus:      
  Cabernet Franc 50%, Merlot 45%, Cabernet Sauvignon 5%.                    
  The Viader was a surprise winner over Cheval Blanc and L'Angelus. All but 
  two of the judges thought that the L'Angelus was the American wine; one   
  taster thought that the Cheval Blanc was the American wine because it was 
  more tannic that the Viader.
