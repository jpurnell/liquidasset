 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2921
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1189. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine F is Domain du P&egrave;re Caboche 2005       
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine A is Domaine du Pegau 2000             
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine C is Les Silex 2000                    
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine E is Domain la Barroche 2005          
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine B is La Bernardine 2000

  6.   ........  6th place    Wine D is Domaine Janasse Chaupin 2005      

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  8.7619. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1189

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Our host upon opening these wines had some trepidatiion about how they       
  would perform in a tasting. As it turns, out with an hour in the glass   
  they opened up and revealed their true character. It was noticeable as 
  remarked by several tasters that the wines has a sweet quality.       
  There was no strong preference between the 2000 and 2005 vintages.        
  These wines are all aging beatifully, The Janasse '05 differfentiated
  itself from the greoup negatively and this was confirmed in the overrall 
  rating.
