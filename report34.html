 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.5627
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0006. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine B is BV Latour 1978                    
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine C is BV Latour 1982                    
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine A is Iron Horse Alexander Valley 1979  
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine D is Jordan 1978                       
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine E is BV Latour 1985

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 23.6327. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0006

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The remarkable thing about this tasting was the strong agreement among    
  tasters. The first place wine received 5 first place votes and 2 second   
  place votes, possibly the greatest agreement we have ever had. The last   
  placed wine was ranked near to last by most tasters, and some thought it  
  was slightly oxidized. One big surprise was the performance of the Iron   
  Horse '79, which would sell for about $15 a bottle in an auction, and was 
  ranked in the top three in this tasting.                                  
                                                                            
  There is general agreement on the high level of the BV George Delatour    
  Private Reserves across three vintages.                                   
                                                                            
  The '79 Latour is an example of an herbacious somewhat green Bordeaux     
  that has just not come around to fulfill its potential.
