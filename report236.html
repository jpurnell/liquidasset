 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0786
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.6780. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is Hermitage La Chapelle 1989
  2.   tied for  2nd place    Wine C is Hermitage La Chapelle 1988
  3.   tied for  2nd place    Wine A is Hermitage La Chapelle 1983
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine F is Hermitage La Chapelle 1998
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine B is Hermitage La Chapelle 1985
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine E is Hermitage La Chapelle 1995

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  3.1429. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.6780

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

                           Pairwise Rank Correlations

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The wines were marvellous, mature and drinking extremely well.We believe
  that the lack of agreement was more a testament to the great overall
  qualityof the wines, with the youngest being 24 years old.

  The tasting was followed by two 100 point wines: the 1990 Hermitage La
  Chapelle and the 1989 Chave Hermitage. The Chave '89 could well have been
  part of the earlier tasting, with the caveat that the '89 was a little
  fresher. The '90 was a league apart. Still with a deep color and soft
  tannins. A brief vote confirmed that we had a 7/8 preference for the
  La Chapelle. Both were delicious. The chocolate dessert was a triumph to
  finish off a great tasting.
