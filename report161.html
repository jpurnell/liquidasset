 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1017
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.5476. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

We now compute for each wine the mean (average) grade it received from the judges
and the standard deviation of those grades. (The mean of, say, 3 grades is 
the sum of the grades divided by 3. The standard deviation is a measure of
the &quot;dispersion&quot; of the grades around the mean. The numbers 5, 6, and 7 and the
numbers 3, 6, and 9 both have the same mean of 6, but the second set has a
higher dispersion, i.e., strandard deviation.

We now compute the mean and the standard deviation for  each judge, from which
you can see which judge is harsh and which is lenient,  which thinks that the
wines are very different and which thinks they are pretty much the same.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1543
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2039. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

We now compute for each wine the mean (average) grade it received from the judges
and the standard deviation of those grades. (The mean of, say, 3 grades is 
the sum of the grades divided by 3. The standard deviation is a measure of
the &quot;dispersion&quot; of the grades around the mean. The numbers 5, 6, and 7 and the
numbers 3, 6, and 9 both have the same mean of 6, but the second set has a
higher dispersion, i.e., strandard deviation.

We now compute the mean and the standard deviation for  each judge, from which
you can see which judge is harsh and which is lenient,  which thinks that the
wines are very different and which thinks they are pretty much the same.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.65 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.56 for significance at the 0.1 level

Comments by Karl Storchman and Orley Ashenfelter:
<p>
At its Annual Conference in Princeton, the American Association of Wine Economists AAWE organized a wine tasting called 
&quot;The Judgment of Princeton.&quot; It was modeled after the 1976 &quot;Judgment of Paris.&quot; In 1976, British wine merchant Steve 
Spurrier organized a blind wine tasting with 9 French judges who were associated with the wine industry in various ways 
(wine journalists, critics, sommeliers, merchants or winemakers).  In the first flight the judges rated 10 white wines, 
6 from Napa and 4 from Burgundy.<br> 

In the second flight,  the judges rated 10 reds, 6 from Napa and 4 from Bordeaux, France. In both tastings a wine from 
Napa,  a then relatively unknown wine region, was declared the winner. George Taber of TIME magazine, the only 
attending journalist, reported the results to the world. The results caused considerable surprise in France and the USA, 
and helped to put Napa wines on the global wine map.
 <br> 
 At the Princeton tasting, now led by George Taber, 9 wine judges from France, Belgium and the U.S. tasted French 
against New Jersey wines. The French wines selected were from the same producers as in 1976 including names such as 
Chateau Mouton-Rothschild and Haut Brion, priced up to $650/bottle. New Jersey wines for the competition were submitted 
to an informal panel of judges, who then selected the wines that would compete. These judges were not eligible to 
taste wines at the final competition. The results were surprising. Although, the winner in each category was a French 
wine (Beaune Clos des Mouches for the whites and Chateau Mouton-Rothschild for the reds) NJ wines barely differed in 
their average rank from those of France. Three of the top four whites were from New Jersey. The best NJ red was ranked 
3rd place. Prices for the NJ wines are typically one-third to one-twentieth of their French competitors.
<br>
A statistical evaluation of the tasting, conducted by Princeton Professor Richard Quandt, which was similar to an 
earlier analysis of the Judgment of Paris (<a href="http://www.liquidasset.com/tasting.html">
http://www.liquidasset.com/tasting.html</a>), further shows that the rank order 
of the wines was mostly insignificant. That is, if the tasting were repeated, the results would most likely be 
different. From a statistical viewpoint, most wines were therefore undistinguishable. Only the best white and the 
lowest ranked red were significantly different from the other wines.
<br>
There was a third similarity to the Paris tasting. In Paris, after the identity of the wines was revealed, Odette Kahn, 
editor of &quot;La Revue du Vin de France,&quot; demanded her scorecard back. Apparently, she was not happy with having rated 
American wines number one and two.
<br>
At the Princeton blind tasting, both French judges preferred NJ red wines over their counterparts from Bordeaux. After 
disclosing the wines’ identity the French judges were surprised but did not complain. In contrast, some tasters from the 
U.S. did not want their wine ratings to be published. Here are some additional links: Wikipedia (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_of_Paris_%28wine%29">
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judgment_of_Paris_%28wine%29</a>, TV clip, JancisRobinson.com (<a href="http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/a201206101.html">
http://www.jancisrobinson.com/articles/a201206101.html</a>), The New Yorker, Marginal Revolution, BlindTaste
<br>
One final set of computations was performed. Mark Censits was present as an observer and himself rated the wines, although
he was not one of the official tasters. It was possibly interesting to redo  the calculations by including him as if he
had been an official taster, and these computations follow below.

 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1202
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.3248. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

We now compute for each wine the mean (average) grade it received from the judges
and the standard deviation of those grades. (The mean of, say, 3 grades is 
the sum of the grades divided by 3. The standard deviation is a measure of
the &quot;dispersion&quot; of the grades around the mean. The numbers 5, 6, and 7 and the
numbers 3, 6, and 9 both have the same mean of 6, but the second set has a
higher dispersion, i.e., strandard deviation.

We now compute the mean and the standard deviation for  each judge, from which
you can see which judge is harsh and which is lenient,  which thinks that the
wines are very different and which thinks they are pretty much the same.

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

 COMMENT:

  The addition of one extra taster does not make much difference. The rank sums, when adjusted for the
  larger number of tasters, are extremely similar to what we found in the case of the 9 original tasters,
  and the W coefficient of concordance hardly changes.

 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1501
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1564. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

We now compute for each wine the mean (average) grade it received from the judges
and the standard deviation of those grades. (The mean of, say, 3 grades is 
the sum of the grades divided by 3. The standard deviation is a measure of
the &quot;dispersion&quot; of the grades around the mean. The numbers 5, 6, and 7 and the
numbers 3, 6, and 9 both have the same mean of 6, but the second set has a
higher dispersion, i.e., strandard deviation.

We now compute the mean and the standard deviation for  each judge, from which
you can see which judge is harsh and which is lenient,  which thinks that the
wines are very different and which thinks they are pretty much the same.

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.65 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.56 for significance at the 0.1 level

Comment: As in the case of the white win es, the addition of one extra taster makes very little difference, with
the exception that the Ch. Moutin Rothschild now turns out to be significantly "good."
