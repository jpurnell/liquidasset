 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2500
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0752. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is Chateau Musar 1995

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 10.0000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0752

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Overall, the Musar wines present a marvellous wine experience and         
  the wines were consistent over btwo decades. Despite this wide range      
  of ages, the wines were homogeneous and did not show big differences      
  that you might expect from such a big range. These wines are renowned for 
  being long lived and this was borne out by our tasting. Given the         
  pricepoint these wines continue to represent tremendous value.            
                                                                            
  There appears to be substantial agreement on the excellence of the 1995   
  and on the relative inferiority of the 1997.                              
                                                                            
  There as no significant difference between the group of three older and   
  three younger wines.
