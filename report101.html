We now measure the amount of correlation (W) among the judges:
W = 1.0 => perfect correlation, W = 0 => no correlation
<br>
We also provide a probability measure that this correlation is due to chance
<br>
In this case the correlation is =     0.3159
<br>
Probability that correlation is due to chance = 0.0002
<br>
We compute the correlation of each taster with the average ranking of the oth-
ers and with prices. 1.0 => perfect, 0 => none, -1.0 => total disagreement

  Comments: This was a wine tasting with a total of 26 judges. The group was divided into two sub-groups 
(in two different rooms): 13 men and 13 women. Note that the two groups (Report101 
and Report102) tasted identical wines. The two groups agreed on which wine was significantly good
and on one of the wines that was significantly bad, but they did not agree on a second wine that
was significantly bad. The rank correlation between the two groups' aggregate evaluations was
0.472, which is not significant statistically at even the 0.1 level.<br>
