 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0640
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.8263. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   tied for  1st place    Wine G is Malartic la Gravi&egrave;re              
  2.   tied for  1st place    Wine H is Lafon-Rochet                     
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine D is Branaire Ducru                    
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine F is Langoa Barton                     
  5.   tied for  5th place    Wine C is Brane Cantenac                    
  6.   tied for  5th place    Wine B is Ormes de Pez                      
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine A is Reserve de la Contesse

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  3.5833. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.8263
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is   0.6988. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.5240 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Ovewrall this was a very high quality vintage. And these wines            
  were of equal quality and similarly rated. It is therefore not surprising
  that we were evenly split in our preferences. Overall these wines were    
  delicious, soft, and drinking at their peak. Should you have any of       
  the '09s in your cellar, open a bottle and enjoy it. The alcohol in       
  these wines ranged from 13.5% and up. All five of the villages of the    
  Medoc were represented in the tasting, which speaks of the consistency   
  of the vintage. There was no clear correlation between the price and the  
  rankings of the wines. Also, Zaki kindly pointed out that the Lafont-Rochet
  had 37% Merlot, which is unusual  for a Medoc.
