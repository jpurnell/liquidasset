 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.6035
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0008. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine A is Ridge Pase Robles Zin 1978        
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine D is Ridge Lytton Springs Zin 1989     
---------------------------------------------------
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine E is Ridge Shenandoah Zin 1979         
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine B is Ridge Glen Ellen Zin 1979         
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine F is Ridge Geyserville Zin 1983        
---------------------------------------------------
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine C is Ridge Jinsomare Zin 1976          

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 21.1224. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0008
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is   0.5161. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.6570 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  One judge suggested that much of the fruit is gone from these wines.      
  Perhaps one of the reasons why the 1989 was liked best is that much of the
  fruit is still there. Even in cases where the fruit was diminished, what  
  was left was wonderful and very interesting. Only one wine was really off,  
  and it had an unpleasant bouquet and indifferent taste, namely the        
  the 1976 Jinsomare, which was the oldest wine in the group. The question  
  really is, what were we really tasting, given that the acidity is low,    
  the tannins are gone, and the fruit is diminished. One other taster       
  remarked that Zins are often approachable young with little tannin and    
  what is remarkable is that these wines have had a long life and sustained 
  their appeal.
