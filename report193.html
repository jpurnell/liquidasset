 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3467
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0070. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine F is Ch. Montrose 2006

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 19.4167. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0070

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  We generally concluded that we don't drink enough Bordeaux wines and      
  that we should drink more. Like some of the tasters presenrt, the 1982 
  Gruaud Larose has seen better days. Today many of us, but not all, preferred  
  the younger wines in the tasting&mdash;but the youngest wine was 10 years old.
  As a general observation, it should be noted that a tasting such as this  
  is always subject to bottle variability and vintage performance           
  differences by chateau: so the individual wines stand on their own.       
  Note that these wines were all recognizably Bordeaux wines but they       
  differed in tannin and acidity. This tasting reminded us how enjoyable    
  it is to drink Bordeaux wines and how well they go with food.
