 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3884
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0028. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 21.7500. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0028

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Petite Sirah is also known as Durif; see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durif">Wikipedia</a> and the footnotes therein. Note
  that we have had another tasting in which Petite Sirahs were featured (but without the
  Zinfandels), almost ten years ago in <a href="report61.html">Report 61</a>. The overlap in vintages
  between that tasting and the present one is too modest to permit an analysis of intertemporal
  consistency.
  
  None of us could recall another tasting in which as many as three out of eight
  wines were judged to be significantly good and as many as two other wines were
  deemed to be significantly inferior: the probability that the observed Kendall
  W could have occurred by chance was 0.0028, another landmark value.
  There was a clear preference among the tasters for the Petite Sirahs, and it was a
  unique tasting in that three of the Petite Sirahs were judged to be significantly good.      
  Many thought that the Zinfandels were obviously alcoholic (2% more        
  alcohol than the Petite Sirahs) and they did not display the fruit that the Petite Sirahs  
  did. The average points against the four Petite Sirahs was 26.75 while the points against
  the four Zinfandels  was 45.25. There are many people who have thought
  that the high alcohol Zinfandels of Turley from the 1990s would          
  turn out to be shallow alcoholic hulls, like some weightlifters who use   
  steroids when young. The good news is that Napa valley Petite Sirahs are underrated   
  wines with much greater longevity and balance.
