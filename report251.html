<div class=body>Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):<br><br>    W = 0.1250<br><br>The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation is rather large, 0.6093. Most analysts would say that unless this probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly related.<br><br>We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group preference.<br>A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a perfect predictor of the group's preferences.<br>A 0.0 means no correlation, while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group. This is measured by the correlation R.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering. The Friedman Chi-Square value is  4.500. The probability that this could happen by chance is  0.609.</div>
<div class=body>We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correlations that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.<br><br></div>
<div class=body>Pairwise Rank Correlations<br><br>Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.753 for significance at the 0.05 level, and must exceed  0.676 for significance at the 0.10 level.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>COMMENT:<br><br>This was a throughly enjoyable tasting featuring the much sought after Kistler single vineyard Pinot noirs.<br>Although the wine maker Steve Kistler had made Pinot noirs alongside his celebrated chardonnays for many years, these wines were all from his Occidental winery, started in 2011. Where possible it was sought to pair the Catherine and Elizabeth cuvées, to provide further comparison. Both daughters work with him in Occidental. <br>The wines were marvelous to drink and we very closely rated with 2 ties amongst them. The SWK vineyard was one of the highest rated wines and in this tasting it was significantly preferred. <br>While the wines were already delicious at 9-10 years of age there was a feeling that they would continue to be enjoyable over the next 5+ years.<br></div>
