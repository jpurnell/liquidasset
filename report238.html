 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0759
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.7506. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine C is Ch. Mouton Rothschild 2001

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  4.2500. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.7506

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

 Overall, this was a heroic attempt to replicate the famous tasting of nthe judgment of Paris. The wines were 
 expertly chosen to closely pair the new and old world wines, and while the Mouton numerically won the tasting,
 the statistical analysis shows there was no significan5t difference between the wines. This demonstrates the
 growing  world of quality wines being produced around the world. What is of particular note is the performance
 of the Canadian Okanagan wine which is a growing influential wine area. The New Jersey wine held its nown
  in the company of some great wines. Its formula was basede on Lascombes and it did much better despite being
  a more recent year. Overall, there is no significant difference between the wines.
  
  The white wine served before the tasting deserves mention. The Stag's Leap SLV Chardonnay was delicious but was
  surpassed by the Bonneau du Martray 2006 Corton Charlemagne.
