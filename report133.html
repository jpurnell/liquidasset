 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2604
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0781. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 12.7619. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0781

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The tasting was from three great vintages from the best vineyards of Roman&eacute;e. 
  Th wines fall roughly into three categories: (1)The 1999 Jayer-Gilles, which had       
  extraordinary bouquet that set it apart from the other wines. (2) The 1990 made by A. F. 
  Gros, the 1999 Grands-Ech&eacute;zeaux made by Potel and the 1993 Grands-Ech&eacute;zeaux 
  made by Engel, which were rated lowest, and (3) all the other wines that essentially tied 
  with each other. Only the 1999 Jayer-Gilles was significantly liked. Interestingly, among
  the three wines that were least favored no winemaker appears more than once and no year 
  appears more than once. The group of Jayer-Gilles wines beats the aggregate of the remaining
  wines: the statistic introduced by Quandt (<em>Journal of Wine Economics</em>, May 2007) is 0.747, 
  while the lower tail critical value is 0.765. But none of the wines disappointed and we would
  be happy to drink any one of them, although except for the Jayer-Gilles 1999, the bouquet of 
  the wines was slow to develop. They were all well within their life span. The Grands-Ech&eacute;zeaux 
  do not perform better than the Ech&eacute;zeaux and there seem to be no major differences 
  among the vintages. Interestingly, the 1999 Potel beat the 1999 Grands-Ech&eacute;zeaux.                      
  The group was surprised by the dark and deep color of many of the wines.  
               
  All this reconfirms how wonderful a great bottle of Ech&eacute;zeaux can be.
