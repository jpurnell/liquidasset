 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2031
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1231. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine E is Grgich Hills, 1999                
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine A is Stags Leap, SLV, 2003             
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine H is Chimney Rock, Alpine, 2004        
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine B is Chimney Rock, Elevage, 2004       
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine F is Etude, 2002                       
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine D is Whitehall Lane 1997

  7.   tied for  7th place    Wine C is Dunn, Howell, 1999

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 11.3750. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1231

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  These were excellent wines. Two tasters thought that wine D, the Whitehall Lane 
  cabernet, was slightly oxidized. Wine E, the Grgich Hills,  
  was preferred by many tasters but it is not normally considered                  
  in the top rank of cabernets. What a pleasant surprise.                  
  One of us remarked and the orthers agreed that there seemed to be     
  little correlation between preferences and  vintages. We all agreed      
  these were typical Napa wines, not monstrous fruit bombs.              
  Relative to other tasting, the group felt that these wines were        
  difficult to distinguish. 
  
  Some might think that it is puzzling that the Grgich Hills did not merit
  being significantly good according to the statistical test, in spite of the
  facts that it scored the smallest &quot;votes&quot; against and that it was 
  scored best by four tasters. However, the runner-up was very close in terms of
  votes against and wines B and H were also close behind, which, so-to-speak, 
  statistically diluted the effect on wine E.
