<div class=body>Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):<br><br>    W = 0.0655<br><br>The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation is rather large, 0.8173. Most analysts would say that unless this probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly related.<br><br>We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group preference.<br>A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a perfect predictor of the group's preferences.<br>A 0.0 means no correlation, while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group. This is measured by the correlation R.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering. The Friedman Chi-Square value is  3.667. The probability that this could happen by chance is  0.817.</div>
<div class=body>We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correlations that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.<br><br></div>
<div class=body>Pairwise Rank Correlations<br><br>Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.705 for significance at the 0.05 level, and must exceed  0.626 for significance at the 0.10 level.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>COMMENT:<br><br>This was a spectacular tasting. It shows the range of different regions in Spain and the different taste preferences and profiles.the wines comprised a combination of Rioja, Ribera del Douro and Priorat plus a Somontano, Showingthe great diversity yet quality being produced. <br>the wines, many acquired in Spain directly went beautifully with the Spanish chorizo and Iberian meats.<br>While these were some of the greatest wines  of Spain the age range was 27yearsapart, showing the great longevity of these wines. <br>Overall this was marvelous and the Riojas showed what what great vale and quality they represent. Somewhat surprising was how the 2 Vega Sicilia wines fared in comparison. Even though there was a low correlation between the judges there was an indication that it was more about preferences than absolute quality with 2 people voting the Unico 1st and 2 others voting it last.<br><br>  </div>
