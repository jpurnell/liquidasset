 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2230
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1539. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   tied for  1st place    Wine D is Moris Farms Avvoltore 2003       
  2.   tied for  1st place    Wine E is La Brancaia  Ilatria 2003

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  9.3673. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1539

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This tasting was comprised of wines from different regions of Italy as    
  well as different vintages; furtermore these wines are made from diverse  
  varietals. Perhaps we should not be surprised then that the stylistic    
  preferences of our tasters resulted in a low correlation. All of us felt  
  that with the exception of the Barbera which was 10 years old, from a      
  varietal consumed young, all were of high quality. Surprisingly, the one      
  Nebbiolo based wine, an Ilio Grasso Barolo, from the 2004 vintage,        
  appeared mature and ready to drink. One  taster remarked that nothing     
  rises to the top of this class. One of the advantages of this type of     
  tasting is that we get to compare different wineries with different       
  vintages. Today, the 2003 vintage, which is a hot but not great           
  vintage, produced two of the wines tied for the top. It  may be worth to         
  look out for bargains as retailers close out the 2003 vintage.
