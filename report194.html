 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3482
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0068. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 19.5000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0068

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  What is interesting in this tasting is that it paired the first and second     
  wines of Latour in 4 vintages. The reason this is fascinating is that at current price  
  levels the Latour sells for at least 4 times as much as the Les Forts. Clearly, based     
  on this tasting, if you wish to have the Latour experience, then the     
  Les Forts is a very good buy and should be tried.
  
  For most of us, the wines were remarkably similar. All had wonderful       
  bouquets and flavors. Overall, the consistency was obvious. All the wines 
  were very drinhkable which, given their age, should not be a surprise but   
  given the reputation of Latour was somewhat pleasing. Many people were  
  surprised that the highly rated wines, by Robert Parker, did  not       
  perform well, in particular the two 100 pointers were rated lowest. The   
  100 pointers were rated 6th and 8th out of the eight wines we tasted.
  
  Since Les Forts wines ended up ranking second, third amd fourth best, it was
  our superficial impression that they generally ranked higher than the Latours. However, 
  the significance test on the rank sum of the Les Forts versus the Latours does not 
  bear out this conjecture: the ratio of the ranksums (divided by the number of 
  items, which of course is the same for the two groups here) is 1.16, whereas the
  critical value for 8 items in two groups of 4 is 1.26. This may be surprising to some 
  because Les Forts won 3 out of the 4 head&ndash;to&ndash;head battles. It is also worth noting
  that the overall winner (Latour 1989) was the lowest Parker-rated wine.
