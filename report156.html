 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2225
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0865. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 12.4583. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0865

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  We  had two guests present and one of them predicted the group preferences
  better than anyone today. These were wines that were distinguishable      
  from one another, but it wasn&acute;t always clear which to prefer. Only one   
  person picked out the Australian wine. The reason for this success in   
  picking out this wine was the overwhelming smell of cherries, taste like  
  chalk and it hit the front of the tongue and not the back. One taster    
  thought the Montelena was too smooth and boring.                        
                                                                            
  These were all typical Napa valley cabernets with lots of fruit, good    
  drinking now and without anyone knowing whether any one of them will    
  get better. The older wines are holding well.                             
                                                                            
  Overture is a second wine of Opus One, carries no vintage date, and many   
  of us were puzzled by how well it performed. It was a wine unknown to    
  everybody but our host.                                                   
                                                                            
  Note that this is not the first time that Opus One has won a tasting,     
  having won against Bordeaux, etc.
