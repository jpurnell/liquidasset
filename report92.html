 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1302
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.4016. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  8.3333. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.4016

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.70 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.60 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  It was a great tasting with very good wines. There was an unusual amount  
  of disagreement in the group and there were no significantly great wines, 
  nor significantly bad ones. There were two separate groupings of three    
  wines each: by the three vintages (1996, 1997, 1998) and by the three     
  Chateaux, representing Pauillac, Pomerol and Graves. While we have no     
  significance test for the sum of the rank sums, they were as follows      
  1996: 150, 1997: 110, 1998: 100; whereas the ranksums for the regions     
  were Pauillac: 116, Pomerol: 125, Graves: 119. The differences among the  
  regions are inconsequential, but those for the vintages seem a bit greater.
  The 1996 wines have a way to go to not contradict their high standings in 
  the ratings. The 1997s more than held their own---a trio in which the     
  Parker ratings say that they should have been drubbed as of now. The same     
  could be said to a lesser extent of the 1998s.
