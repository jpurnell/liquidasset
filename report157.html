 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3266
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0107. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine G is Bandol Tempier, Cuv&eacute;e Classique 2003

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 18.2917. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0107

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  One person said, with humour, that the sausage rolls won. The group was    
  particularly pleased to taste  what to us was a unique group of wines.    
  One member wondered whether the fact that these are wines with which    
  we are not terribly familiar enabled us to rank the wines without          
  distinct stylistic preferences. Note that there was much more agreement    
  concerning the ranking of wines than is usual in the group. There were   
  slight differences in tannin and acidity.  While it was expected that    
  the Tempier and the Trevallon would rank very high, the Val Joannis was a 
  surprise, a relatively less known wine.Our host purchased most of these
  wines at the vineyards. The Mas de da Dame was the vineyard painted by   
  Van Gogh during his stay at St. R&eacute;my in 1889. The Pibarnon is well known  
  for its amphitheater-like vineyards overlooking the         
  Mediterranean at Toulon. The Ch. Val Joannis in the Luberon is well known for  
  its famous garden, which is well worth a visit.
