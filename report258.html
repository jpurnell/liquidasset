<div class=body>Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):<br><br>    W = 0.1252<br><br>The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation is rather large, 0.3425. Most analysts would say that unless this probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly related.<br><br>We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group preference.<br>A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a perfect predictor of the group's preferences.<br>A 0.0 means no correlation, while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group. This is measured by the correlation R.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering. The Friedman Chi-Square value is  7.889. The probability that this could happen by chance is  0.343.</div>
<div class=body>We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correlations that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.<br><br></div>
<div class=body>Pairwise Rank Correlations<br><br>Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.705 for significance at the 0.05 level, and must exceed  0.626 for significance at the 0.10 level.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>COMMENT:<br><br>Overall this was a lovely tasting conducted as a partial homage to an old friend who loved Italian wines and who educated the group on the beauty of Italian wine and Barolo in particular. <br>Interestingly with regard to these northern Nebbiolo reds, it is generally agreed that the first two decades of the 21st century brought reliably stronger vintages than the preceding two or three and – thanks to varied, intricate topography – some sites were poised to benefit from gradual warming the the world is experiencing. The range of vintages being tasted were all ranked in the 94-95 range, suggesting that they were all ready to drink but had a good future ahead of them. This was confirmed by the tasting.<br>There was some discussion around the spread of individual preferences between the tasters, while agreeing that there was no wine that was considered poor. The top 3 wines also covered the span of years of the tasting with the ‘younger’ wines not being more noticeably preferred to the turn of the century bottles.<br>Once again a delicious tasting demonstrating not only the longevity of these wines but how approachable and enjoyable they are to drink. Thanks to Ed for teaching us about these lovely wines and our gracious host.<br></div>
