     ( 5 is the best possible,  35 is the worst)

<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1143
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.7534. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine G is Ch. Margaux 1990                  
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine A is Ch. Cheval Blanc 1990             
  3.   tied for  3rd place    Wine C is Ch. Haut Brion 1990               
  4.   tied for  3rd place    Wine D is Ch. Meyney 1990                   
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine E is Ch. Lafite Rothschild 1990        
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine F is Ch. Bourgneuf 1990                
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine B is Ch. Leoville Barton 1990          

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  3.4286. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.7534

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This was an extraordinarily wonderful wine tasting and the lack of        
  agreement indicates that these were all wonderful wines and 1990 is a     
  wonderful vintage, says Burt. Bob adds athat he agrees with Burt, these   
  are amazing wines, perhaps the best of the century. Differentiation is    
  more noise than anything else. John says that these wines were all so good
  that the dispersion is unusually high, as expected. Grant says that the   
  wines have great fruit.
