 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0945
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.6244. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  5.2917. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.6244

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Of the many tastings we have had, this may be the4 only that we have      
  dedicated to the wines of Bandol. These wines spanned an age range        
  of 21 to 9 years of age, which is particularly important given         
  Bandol's reputation for age in bottle. Nonethe;less, the bulk of the      
  wines tasted in the ten year old range.                                   
  Some of us were pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the wines,    
  and others expected the wines would have a more rustic quality. These     
  wines were uniformly consistent in their style.
  Bandol reds use Mourvedre (>50%) and may also use Grenache and Cinsault,
