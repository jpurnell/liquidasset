 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2429
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.4336. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine F is Ch. Latour 1990                   
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine C is Ch. Latour 1959                   
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine D is Ch. Latour 1964                   
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine E is Ch. Latour 1962                   
  5.   tied for  5th place    Wine A is Ch. Latour 1980                   
  6.   tied for  5th place    Wine B is Ch. Latour 1970                   

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  4.8571. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.4336

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  These wines were all decanted 3.5 hours befgore the tasting. There was an 
  enormous similarity among the wines, given they were between 60 years old 
  to the youngest being 32 years old.                                       
  The wines were spectacular. The 1990 waS preferred and has many years     
  ahead of it. The 1959 was spectacular given its age, coming in a close    
  second. The 1980, an off vintage, probably the wine of the vintage in its 
  day, but was overshadowed by this company. It held its own with the much  
  lauded 1970. On its own it would still be delightful and showing life.    
  This shows the great predictability of Ch. Latour over a long period. None
  of the vintages was showing particular signs of age. What is noticeable is
  the the prices of these wines compare very favorably with and nin some    
  cases are cheaper than wines that are currently trading (2005 to 2014).   
  Given that Latour benefits from considerable aging one has to ask why are 
  wine lovers not buying these fabulous vintage wines rather than young     
  Latours that may need a furether 15+ years of patient storage? Overall,   
  Latour is a benchmark Bordeaux that can be relied upon. If you find an odd
  vintage, buy it and you are unlikely to be disappointed.
