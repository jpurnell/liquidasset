     ( 6 is the best possible,  42 is the worst)
<br>
<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1627
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.4394. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine F is Ch. Beychevelle                   
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine B is Ch. Pape Clement                  
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine G is Ch. Certan de May                 
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine A is Ch. Brane Cantenac                
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine D is Ch. Smith Haut Lafite             
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine C is Monbusquet                        
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine E is Bellisle Mondotte                 

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  5.8571. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.4394

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  There was little agreement in the group, as is witnessed by the number    
  of wines that were ranked first by some and last by other tasters. The Ch,
  Beychevelle stood out, but all the wines were good and enjoyable. The 2005 vintage
  was much heralded on launch as the best since 2000 and it wqas stated that the
  vintage was uniformly good high to low with a focus on the right bank and Pessac/
  Grave. At 15 years of age the wines were expected to be showing signs of opening
  up. To our surprise the wines weree still at the early stages of approachability and 
  may have many years to go before they reach their peak. The wines were all tasting well but tghe 
  Ch. Beychewvelle was a clear winner which is a tribute to the wine maker and perhaps the region.
  The left bank wines performed better than the right bank wines.
