                        The Judges's Rankings

              Wine ->   A   B   C   D   E   F   G
<br>
     Group Ranking ->   3   7   5   6   1   2   3

     ( 5 is the best possible,  35 is the worst)
<br>
<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.4229
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0483. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

       Correlation Between the Ranks of
 Each Person With the Average Ranking of Others
<br>
  Name of Person      Correlation R

  Bob                   0.6847
  Malcolm               0.4505
  Tom                   0.3214
  Manny                 0.1261
  Hal                   0.0000

<br>
The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine E is 1998
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine F is 1994
  3.   tied for  3rd place    Wine A is Caymus Special Selection 1992
  4.   tied for  3rd place    Wine G is 1987
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine C is 1996
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine D is 1988
---------------------------------------------------
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine B is 1997

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 12.6857. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0483

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

                           Pairwise Rank Correlations

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

COMMENTS:

This wine tasting was held in Bermuda, by our Bermuda member Bob.

These wines were all in excellent shape and tasting well, including the youngest. 
In fact, the very youngest, the 1998, had a stunning score of three first place and two
second place votes, which was as close to a perfect score as many of us have seen.
Interestingly, it was among the vintages least favored by Parker. The 1998 had quintessential
Caymus characteristics: full body, blackcurrant, toasty oak and spicy quality.
All the wines to one extent or another, exhibited similar characteristics, but the
1998 was overwhelming. This tasting seems to confirm that Caymus Special Selection
is an outstanding Cabernet and one that can be drunk young.
