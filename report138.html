 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1789
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2637. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine H is Mt.Difficulty, Central Otego, 2004

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 10.0190. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.2637

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.70 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.60 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

 The present tasting of Pinot Noirs covers numerous regions, as shown in the Table below:<br>
  <table align="center">
  <tr><td>Hamilton Russell</td><td>South Africa</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Veramonte</td><td>Chile</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Mt. Difficulty</td><td>New Zealand</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Morey St. Denis</td><td>France, C&ocirc;te de Nuits</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Clos des Mouches</td><td>France, C&ocirc;te de Beaune</td></tr>
  <tr><td>F&uuml;rst Sp&auml;tburgunder</td><td>Germany</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Szeremley Huba</td><td>Hungary</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Vital</td><td>U. S., Oregon</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Saintsbury</td><td>U. S., California</td></tr>

  We had originally hoped that, by and large, the tasters would be able to identify
  many of the regions represented by these wines; at a minimum, that they would be
  able to identify the French and the American wines. This was not to be the case, and
  by common agreement we decided not to attempt this exercise. There was relatively little
  agreement among the judges, but for Pinot Noir lovers this tasting confirms our view that      
  it is hard to find a Pinot Noir that we do not love. The wines were by no means identical;
  some had more acid than others, a couple showed minor signs of fermentation, and so on.
  
  The New Zealand Mt. Difficulty won first place and the two French wines were near the bottom 
  of the rankings. The host for the evening intentionally did not include some blockbuster Grands 
  Crus among the French wines, in order to make the &quot;competition&quot; fairer, and the French 
  obviously suffered from this attempt at evenhandedness. The group was asked if they were willing 
  to try to identify which wines were the French ones. Five judges were willing to do so. Five
  judges picking two wines makes for a total of 10 identifications; not one of the 10 was a French wine.
  Four of the identifications were the Mt. Difficulty, four were the Saintsbury, and one each the 
  Vital and the Hamilton Russell. Three of these four identifications were among the top three in
  the rankings, which just goes to show the prevailing prejudice: if it is good, it must be French.
