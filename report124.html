     ( 6 is the best possible,  42 is the worst)
<br>
<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.5278
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0042. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is Ch. Latour '53                    
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine F is Ch. Latour '80                    
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine E is Ch. Mouton Rothschild '67         
  4.   tied for  4th place    Wine G is Ch. Latour '83                    
  5.   tied for  4th place    Wine B is Ch. Latour '79                    
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine C is Ch. Pichon Longueville Baron '75

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 19.0000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0042

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  It is very unusual to taste such a great range of distinguished wines     
  including a variety of great and off vintages. In particular we had the   
  opportunity to taste a variety of Latour vintages that are renowned for   
  their performance in off years. The '53  Latour performed consistent      
  with its reputation. What was more surprising was the performance of      
  the off vintages, particularly the '80 Latour and the '67 Mouton.         
  In the light of the astronomical prices that are being asked for               
  recent first growths, it is often worth while to take a chance on         
  older vintages, including those of lesser repute when available at        
  attractive prices. On the whole, this shows that the older Bordeaux are   
  holding up well.
