<div class=3Dbody>COMMENT:<br><br>The Dominus estate, first known as the Nap=
anook vineyard, dates back to the mid 19th century, with its vineyards likel=
y planted around 1836 by founder George C Yount. Christian Moueix looking fo=
r a Californian winery identified Dominus Estate as the pick of the bunch an=
d entered into partnership in 1982 with the then-owners Robin Lail and Marci=
a Smith before becoming the sole owner in 1995.<br>Overall this was a marvel=
ous tasting of somewhat old school classic style of Napa Cabernet Sauvignon w=
ines. they were extremely enjoyable. For most of the tasters this was the fi=
rst time they have enjoyed a vertical of this winery. They were considered a=
typical for today=E2=80=99s Napa wines with more restrained fruit and an alm=
ost Bordeaux style. It is a food friendly style that appears to be capable o=
f further aging, given that the wines apart from a slight difference in colo=
r showed little signs of age. While there was no significant difference betw=
een these wines it=E2=80=99s worth noting that the top two wines were indivi=
dually rated 99 and 100 points. There is a second wine Napanook and a third c=
alled Othello. <br>The winery is often used in blind tasting against Bordeau=
x wines, Dominus=E2=80=99 grand vin =E2=80=93 a variable blend of Cabernet S=
auvignon, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc =E2=80=93 is born of the estate=E2=
=80=99s unique volcanic terroir, 25-year-old vines and commitment to authent=
ic Bordeaux-style winemaking practices. The production at 7,000 cases also p=
uts it in a similar size to mid sized top Bordeaux chateau=E2=80=99s with pr=
