 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.7464
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0000. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine E is Bonnes Mares 1976                 
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine D is Corton Renards 1976               
---------------------------------------------------
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine F is Musigny 1976                      
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine A is Clos Vougeot 1976                 
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine C is Vosne Romanee 1976                
---------------------------------------------------
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine B is Clos de la Vigne 1976

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 31.3469. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0000

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This tasting produced one of the highest levels of agreement among the    
  tasters that has ever been recorded by us before or after this event. All 
  tasters but one ranked the Corton Grancey last, making me wonder at the   
  time of this writing (12/20/2011) whether this Corton might have been a   
  bad bottle (but my memory no longer serves to illuminate a tasting        
  that took place almost exactly 16 years ago). At the same time, all       
  tasters ranked the Bonnes Mares first and the Corton Renards a close      
  second. The 1976s have essentially disappeared from auctions and they     
  are so old now that they would have to be approached with extreme caution,
  but it warms my heart to remember them.
