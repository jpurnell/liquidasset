 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3980
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0044. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine G is Turley Rattlesnake PS 1999        
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   tied for  2nd place    Wine H is Stag's Leap PS 1999               
  3.   tied for  2nd place    Wine E is Bogle PS 2000                     
  4.   tied for  4th place    Wine F is Rockland PS 1999                  
  5.   tied for  4th place    Wine C is David Bruce PS 2000

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 22.2857. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0044
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is  -0.0840. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.4830 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.70 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.60 for significance at the 0.1 level

<p>COMMENT:
  This was a tasting os Petite Syrahs (PS) from California.

  Wine B was the Stag's Leap Wine Cellars, made by Warren                   
  Winiarski, while Wine H was the competitor, Stag's Leap Winery. These     
  are wineries that are entirely different, but with similar names---and    
  there has been much litigation over exactly this point. </p>
<p>                    
  Everyone agreed that the wines were very drinkable right now. In addition 
  it should be noted that the alcohol levels in thesse wines were never less
  than 13% and ranged up to 14.5%. </p>
  <p>                                         
  The negative correlation of group prerences with price was particularly   
  surprising, because the first place wine was the most expensive,          
  and an order of magnitude more expensive than the second and third place  
  wines. In other words, the first placed wine was ten times more expensive 
  than the second and third place wines, and the last placed wine was five  
  times more expensive than the second placed wine. The Bogle 2000 PS was   
  simply an extraordinary wine selling at $10. The only other time that this
  has happened in this group was when a $15 South                           
  African Cabernet was judged superior to some equivalent first growth     
  South Africans. The group thought that the wines were really delicious.   
  PS is said to be the same as Durif; the question is, are there Durifs from France of the same quality?
