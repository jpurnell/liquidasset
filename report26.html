     ( 7 is the best possible,  35 is the worst)




 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):


     W = 0.5714




 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0030. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.


  1.   ........  1st place    Wine A is J Phelbs,Cabernet,Napa 97         
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine B is Sterling Vineyards,Cabernet,Napa 9
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine C is R Mondavi,Cabernet,Coastal 97     
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine D is Undurraga Reserva,Maipo/Chile 96

  5.   ........  5th place    Wine E is R Mondavi,Cabernet, Napa 96       

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 16.0000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0030

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.90 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

<p>  Most of the judges were not expierenced in drinking wine let alone in     
  doing wine tastings. Nevertheless everyone agrees that the Joseph         
  Phelbs is an outstanding wine. The included supermarket-wine from         
  Chile was considered to be the worst. The Mondavi Napa Cabernet was corked
  and should have been excluded from the tasting.                           
  Interesting is also a simple regression between ranking and price for     
  the correlation seems to be almost perfect. The retailer prices were: </p>
