 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.4665
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0033. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is Ch. La Conseillante 1990          
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine A is Ch. Palmer 1990                   
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine B is Ch. Pichon Longueville, Lalande 19
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine C is Ch. Leoville las Cases 1990       
---------------------------------------------------
  5.   tied for  5th place    Wine F is Ch. Margaux 1990                  
  6.   tied for  5th place    Wine G is Ch. Cos d'Estournel 1990

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 19.5918. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0033

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Fact 1: Prices of the wines, which we did not know during the tasting,    
  Palmer $70, Pichon Lalande $90, Leoville Las Cases $145, Conseillante     
  $200, Ausone $145, Margaux $375, Cos d'Estournel $100. Fact 2: in a       
  previous tasting Margaux was ranked first, and that is why it was included
  in this tasting.Fact 3: prior to seeing the rankings, it was widely agreed
  that these were all outstanding wines and it was not expected that there  
  would be significant differences in the rankings. To the surprise of      
  everyone, there was overwhelming agreement on the first-place wine-which  
  was not the wine that won the previous tasting. Fact 4: Despite the fact  
  that these were very young wines, they were all accessible and delicious. 
  We note that price is not necessarily an indicator of quality at this time.
  An explanation for why the wines that did well did so is that in our    
  tasting group the wines are judged according to their quality for drink-  
  ing today. The group agreed on the qualities of the most favored wines,   
  but expressed this in varying ways, describing them alternately as soft,  
  spicy, and balanced, without too much tannin.
