 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2571
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0675. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine C is Palmaris Outer Coastal Plan Tomasello res.
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine F is Bellview Outer Coastal Plain      
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine B is Silver Decoy (now Working Dog)   
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine A is Chinon Joguet                     
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine E is Saumur Champigny Chateau de Huran - Vatan
---------------------------------------------------
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine D is Bourgueil Breton                   

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 10.2857. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0675

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Cabernet Franc seems to do well in New Jersey, and some of us have wondered how
  these wines compare to the red wines of Loire, which are made from cabernet franc
  (usually easier to ripen and lighter than cabernet sauvignon). The 2010 vintage
  in New Jersey was exceptional, a hot and dry summer. In the Loire the views are 
  more mixed about the vintage. Parker rates it 88, a little above average among
  the last 10 vintages, while Wine Spectator expected it to be outstanding.
  
  The new Jersey wines presented themselves very well and they clearly   
  won the tasting. (The rank sums for the Loire wines are 101 and for the NJ wines 67.)
  Three of the eight tasters correctly identified the NJ wines.     
                                                                
  The weather was exceptionally good that year in NJ (2010) but             
  weather differences may account for some of the results. In one    
  taster's experience the wines from the Loire have an unripe  green         
  character which it turns out is considered a defect.
