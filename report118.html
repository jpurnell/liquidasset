     ( 6 is the best possible,  48 is the worst)
<br>
<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2275
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2152. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine E is Bressandes (Prince Florent) 2002  
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine A is Bressandes (Prince Florent) 2005  
  3.   tied for  3rd place    Wine H is Clos du Roi (Girardin)  1997      
  4.   tied for  3rd place    Wine C is Bressandes (Lucien de Moine) 2003 
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine D is Renardes (Girardin) 1998          
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine B is (Toillot-Beaut) 1995              
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine F is Clos du Roi (Vougeraie)  2002

  8.   ........  8th place    Wine G is Clos du Roi (Chandon de Brialles) 

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  9.5556. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.2152
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is  -0.2988. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.5240 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  These are well made and relatively young wines, and from the same         
  vineyard, albeit one of the largest in Burgundy. There were no corked     
  wines, or wines with other obvious flaws.                                 
  The most preferred wine, by a top Burgundian producer, Prince Florent de 
  Meraude, achieved a distinguished consensus. This demonstrates, among    
  other things,the quality of the 2002 vintage.                                  
  The  Prince Florent wines were number 1 and 2 in the tasting and that     
  suggests the high quality of this producer, although strictly speaking, 
  there is an identification problem here, since the top two wines were Corton 
  Bressandes, which also tied for third place. Furthermore, the number 2     
  placing of the 2005 vintage is suggestive that this vintage may   
  have overall good potential. As a side note, we observe that the Prince de
  Florent wines had a lighter, some would say more correct, color.
  
  The interested reader may wish to compare this tasting to another Corton tasting that took 
  place almost one year later, which is reported in <a href="report126.html">Report 126</a>.
