 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2453
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0469. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine F is Casanova di Neri

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 15.7000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0469

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.70 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.60 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This tasting is particularly interesting because it is a partial repeat of a 
  tasting of Brunello di Montalcino held on <a href="report152.html">October 3, 2011</a>.
  Four of the wines tasted today were identical to four tasted on the earlier occasion.
  On that occasion, we were in significant agreement among ourselves, and once again, we
  found ourselves in substantial, statistically significant agreement, as witnessed by the
  W coefficient of concordance. Moreover, the four wines that represent the overlap between
  the two tastings, were ranked similarly in the two tastings: The Casanova di Neri was first 
  in both, the Castelgiocondo was second in today's and fourth in last October's tasting, while
  the Conti Constanti was fourth today and the Poggio Antico ninth a year ago.
  
  The wines were all very good and it is quite remarkable that in a group of wines with such 
  a strong family resemblance there was as much agreement in the group as we found. Nonetheless,
  there were differences between the more traditional style Brunellos and the more modern 
  stylings which may explain the relatively slight taste differences within the group. As indicated 
  before, it is noteworthy that the Casanova di Neri which was No. 1 in this tasting, was also No. 1 
  in the previous tasting as well as the Brunello tied for the highest rating in the Wine Spectator 
  at 97 points. 
  
  A final point of interest is to examine whether there is a sign ificant differemce between the riserva 
  wines and the rest. The sum of the ranks for the four riserva wines divided by 4 is 38.5 and the sum 
  for the 5 non-riserva wines divided by 5 is 41.2; this is not a significant difference.
