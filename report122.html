 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3812
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0274. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine B is 1995 Ch. Musar                    
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine A is 1997 Merryvale Profile            
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine D is 1997 Brunello di Montalcino, Fanti
---------------------------------------------------
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine C is 1996 Ch. Lascombes                

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  9.1500. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0274

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  1.00 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  We first note the host's ingenious design. Each flight had a '97 American  
  Cabernet, a '96 Bordeaux, a '97 Brunello and one "mystery wine" from the  
  1990s, that remained unidentified until the end of the tasting. All the   
  wines were in impeccable condition and had been decanted. The degree of   
  agreement among the judges was remarkable and statistically highly signi- 
  ficant. Everybody realized that wine B was the mystery wine but nobody    
  identified it. One taster thought that B might have been a Burgundy       
  because of its color, nose and taste; but Ch. Musar does that to you at   
  times.

 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3562
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0359. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine A is 1996 Lynch Bages                  
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   tied for  2nd place    Wine B is 1997 Brunello di Montalcino, Carmigliano
  3.   tied for  2nd place    Wine D is 1997 Martin Ray Diamond Mountain

  4.   ........  4th place    Wine C is 1992 Penfolds Grange              

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  8.5500. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0359

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  1.00 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The degree of agreement among the judges continued in this second flight. 
  Ch. Lynch Bages was the easy winner and it is surpising that the Penfolds 
  showed up as badly as it did.

 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2188
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1544. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine A is 1997 Spotswood (Napa)             
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine D is 1996 Ch. d'Armailhac              
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine C is 1997 Brunello di Montalcino Altesi

  4.   ........  4th place    Wine B is 1999 Bodegas y Vinedos Alion      

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  5.2500. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1544

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  1.00 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The agreement among the judges was slightly less strong in Flight 3. The  
  Napa wine was the winner in this flight and the Spanish wine, from        
  Ribera del Duero, the loser.                                              
                                                                            
  Overall, this was a most interesting and rewarding tasting.
