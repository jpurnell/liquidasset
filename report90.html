 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3500
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0244. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   tied for  1st place    Wine A is Dierberg 2003                     
  2.   tied for  1st place    Wine E is Sadler-Wells 2002                 
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine D is Melville 2004                     
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine B is Ribbon Ridge 2002

  5.   ........  5th place    Wine C is Derbes 2002                       

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 11.2000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0244
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is   0.7632. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.8000 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.90 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Overall the wines were good. There was one wine that was significantly    
  weaker than the others, lighter and not appreciated by the group. As to   
  the prices, one wine was quite a bit overpriced at $60 for something      
  very comparable for California wines at half the price. These were all    
  West Coast Pinot Noirs, all the way from Santa Barbara to Portland        
  Oregon.                                                                   
                                                                            
  To many tasters the wines seemed assembled, as if they had been blended   
  or constructed to emphasize some flavors over others. One taster felt that
  the 2002's on the average showed better than the others. However, during  
  the tasting the 2003 and 2004 seemed to be developing nicely. It would be 
  a good idea to retaste these wines in three or four years.
