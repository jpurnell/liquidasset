      Today's tasting comprises two flights of relatively inexpensive 2005 Bordeaux wines. The same
	  judges participated in both flights.
<br>
<br>
                                     FLIGHT 1:
                              Number of Judges =  7
                              Number of Wines  =  8

     ( 7 is the best possible,  56 is the worst)
<br>
<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1516
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.3857. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.
<br>
 The correlation I measures the degree to which the identification of each 
 judge is correlated with the truth. Here a 1.0 means that the judge identified
 the wines perfectly, and a 0 means that he identified none of them.

<br>
The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine B is Ch. Bellisle Mondotte, St. Emilion
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine C is Ch. de Lavagnac, St. Emilion      
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine F is La Sacristie de Vielle Cure, Fronsac
  4.   tied for  4th place    Wine G is Ch. La Bourr&eacute;e, C&ocirc;tes de Castillon
  5.   tied for  4th place    Wine D is Ch. Quercy, St. Emilion Grand Cru 
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine A is Ch. La Rose Mayat, Puissegon St.Emilion
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine E is Ch. Lauriol, C&ocirc;tes de Francs      
  8.   ........  8th place    Wine H is Ch. St. Sulpice                   

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  7.4286. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.3857
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is  -0.4909. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.5240 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This is the first of two flights of tastings from 2005  Bordeaux wines. 
  They all tasted remarkably good and drinkable. They all had very soft     
  tannins and the top four wines were really quite outstanding. At least    
  two of the top four wines in this tasting had a high Merlot content       
  which may account for their relatively high rankings. The ripeness of the 
  fruit in these wines is also quite evident. But overall, the wines were quite 
  comparable, which is revealed by the facts that the overall correlation in the 
  group was quite low and that none of the wines was significantly preferred over
  the others.

 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0690
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.8477. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine E is Ch. Puy Bardens, C&ocirc;tes de Bordeaux
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine G is Ch. Barreyre, Bordeaux Sup&eacute;rieur  
  3.   tied for  3rd place    Wine F is Ch. le Pavillon de Boyrein, Graves
  4.   tied for  3rd place    Wine D is Ch. Marjosse, Grand vin Bordeaux

  7.   ........  7th place    Wine B is Ch. Pey La Tour, Bordeaux Sup&eacute;rieur

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  3.3810. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.8477
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is   0.0060. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.5240 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This second flight of wines was not quite as impressive as the first      
  flight. However, one taster thought the exact opposite. This taster 
  thought that the second flight had more grape variety and that in this  
  flight there was more cabernet. In any event, the wines were very enjoyable.
  We note that the rank sums in this group were even more tightly bunched
  than in Flight 1 (which does not necessarily reflect the quality of the
  wines, but possibly the increasing randomness in the tasters' choices 
  resulting from the consumption of a second set of eight bottles).   
  It is important to note that the 2005  Bordeaux are ready to drink now    
  and are extremely enjoyable. Because of their prices, these wines are     
  tremendous values. Buy them now.
