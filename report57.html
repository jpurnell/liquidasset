                              Number of Judges =  7

     ( 7 is the best possible,  49 is the worst)
<br>
<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3732
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0156. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

       Correlation Between the Ranks of
 Each Person With the Average Ranking of Others

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine B is Ch. Cheval Blanc 1962
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine C is Ch. Mouton Baron Philippe 1961
---------------------------------------------------
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine D is Ch. Rausan Segla 1962
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine A is Ch. Kirwan 1962
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine G is Ch. Rouget 1961
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine E is Ch. Ausone 1962
---------------------------------------------------
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine F is Ch. Rouget 1962

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 15.6735. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0156

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

                           Pairwise Rank Correlations

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  There are two critical pieces of information: 1. the two highest rated
  wines came from bottles with serious ullage, midshoulder; 2. the wines
  demonstrate how important it is to have mature old Bordeaux wines in the
  context of a meal. To elaborate: virtually all of the wines would have
  been partners at a dinner party. Tasted alone, they are not competitive
  with modern juicy-fruity high alcohol wines.

  The wines that were ranked low seemed in poorer condition than the
  wines that were ranked highly.
