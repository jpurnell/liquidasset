California Versus All Challengers:  The 1999 Cabernet Challenge</div></b><br>
<br>
<div align="center">by</div><br><div align="center">Orley Ashenfelter</div>
<p>Many people mark the emergence of California cabernet sauvignon
from the shadow of the greatest French wines with a challenge staged 
in Paris in 1976.  Pitting the finest California and Bordeaux wines 
against each other on the 200th anniversary of the 
founding of the United States seemed like a great publication 
relations gimmick.  But more  was accomplished:  On French soil 
and with a distinguished panel of French judges, a California 
cabernet was judged the winner!  (To see the complete details of 
this 1976 challenge, including the scores awarded and the names of 
the judges, take a look at the results by clicking here on <a href="corsica.htm#taste76">1976 Tasting</a>).</p>
<p><a name="continue"></a>In the intervening years, many new cabernet and cabernet-type wines 
have been created in California, Washington, Australia, Latin America, and even in France. 
 Dennis Foley (<a href="mailto:foleywine@hotmail.com">foleywine@hotmail.com</a>), the world's premier organizer of wine events, decided to
 put the new wines to the test.  In an organizational demonstration 
 the likes of which will never be seen again, Dennis arranged for 
 47 of the greatest cabernet-based wines from the 1994 and 1995 
 vintages to be tasted by 33 of the most celebrated people in the 
 California wine world.</p>
<p>Held on May Day as part of a charity function for Gordon Getty's 
Imagine Foundation, the tasters gathered promptly at 11:00 am in a 
lovely room on the top of the St. Francis Hotel.  The wines were 
served entirely blind, and in random order in five flights,
accompanied by a multi-course luncheon.  All the glasses were left 
on the table for the judges to ponder throughout the event.</p>
<p>The cast of judges reads like a who's who of California wine 
celebrities:  they included Warren Winiarski (whose Stag's Leap 
Wine Cellars cabernet had won the 1976 challenge!), Paul Draper 
(who has presided over winemaking at legendary Ridge Vineyards for
 30 years), Ric Forman (who led Sterling to produce some legendary 
 cabernets in the 1970s, but is now at the eponymous  Forman 
 Vineyards), Archie McLaren (who presides over the Central Coast's 
 outstanding benefit auction for public radio's station KCBX),
Bipin Desai (the University of California physicist who has organized 
many great wine events) and many others.  Those pouring the wine 
included all-stars like the knowledgeable Master of Wine Larry Stone (of Rubicon) 
and the perky sommelier Andrea Immer (formerly of Jardiniere).</p>
<p>And the wines, oh the wines.  These had to include the great 
California classics like Caymus Special Selection, Stag's Leap Cask 
23, and Ridge Monte Bello, but they also had to include the new 
generation of pricey all-stars like Araujo Eisele, Dalla Valle
 Maya, Screaming Eagle, Harlan Estate, and Getty's own Plumpjack 
 Reserve.  The challengers had to include the great Bordeaux first 
 growths like Petrus, Cheval-Blanc, Haut-Brion, Margaux, Mouton, 
 Lafite, and Latour, but they also included Le Pin, the new 
chateau that now produces the priciest wine in all of Bordeaux.  
From the state of Washington there were Leonetti Cellars, deLille, 
and Quilceda Creek, while Italy was represented by  Sassicaia (the 
leading super-Tuscan) and Ornellaia, and Spain was repres
ented by l'Ermita.</p>
<p>Dennis  Foley asked that I take charge of the scoring of these 
wines and, in due course, all the results will appear in <i><font color="FF0000">
Liquid Assets:  the International Guide to Fine Wines</i></font>.</p>
<p>Three key conclusions may be drawn at this point.  First, much to 
the surprise of both Dennis Foley and myself, the preferences of the 
judges were, in fact, quite highly correlated.  What this means is 
that the rank order the judges produced would not simply have 
occurred by chance.  Thus, the ordering that follows represents, 
to some extent, a partial consensus on just what it is that these 
California wine makers are trying to accomplish in their young wines.  
Second, among these young wines, all from strong vintages, the 
Bordeaux wines were severely trounced by the wines from virtually 
every other region.  Chateaux Margaux, the highest ranked Bordeaux 
wine, managed to squeak in at 23<sup>rd</sup> place, barely in the top half of 
the wines being ranked!</p>
<p>Finally, the top wines included some of California's (and 
Washington's) new, hard-to-find boutique producers, but it also 
included some of the great classics.  Here is the list of the top 
10 wines (calculated by converting each judge's point score to a rank 
and summing the ranks, or &quot;points against&quot;):  
1.  Clark-Claudon '95 (an unbelievable performance for this newcomer 
and one of the sleepers of the tasting), 2.  Beringer Bancroft 
Ranch '94 (a merlot), 3.  Araujo Eisele '94 (a new producer, 
Araujo, but a long-established vineyard, Eisele), 4.  Stag's Leap 
Cask 23 '95 (Warren Winiarski's classic wins again!), 5.  Caymus 
Special Selection '95 (another classic), 6.  Dalla Valle Maya '94, 
7.  Leonetti Cellars ' 95 (the Washington super star), 8.  
Screaming Eagle '95, 9.  Arietta '96, and 10.  Kefraya Cuvee M '96 
(another amazing sleeper-from Lebanon!)</p><br>

<p>The format in this tasting is flawed and the analysis seems to be incomplete.</p><p>
The judges are all members of the West Coast wine establishment. Are we supposed to be surprised that they prefer and can distinguish their own style of wine in a blind tasting? I think not. </p>
<p>The lack of maturity of the wines (mostly 1994 and 1995 vintages) works against the French wines. Tasting 1995 Latour now is not materially different than tasting it from the barrel before bottling.
No one should even care what a four-year old Latour tastes like.
To say it was "severely trounced" by California wines designed to be drunk at release date is absurd!
Notice, for example, that a 1997 Chateau Los Boldos (Los who??) finished ahead of Latour, Lafite, Mouton and Petrus.</p>
<p>I am confused by the statistical analysis. It is true that the Kendall W is significant, but doesn't this only mean that the judges are in significant agreement? Are we also to interpret the results as meaning that the entire rank order of 47 wines is significant, i.e., that each wine in the list is significantly 
better than the wine ranked just below it? This is hard to believe.
I would prefer to know Kramer's critical values (5% levels) for the rank sums. Even though this test overstates the number of significant wines, it 
would still be of interest. In particular, I would like to know
if the conclusion "Winiarski wins again" has any merit at all.</p>

Kendall's W:

Variable |     Obs      Value
---------+----------------------
   wcorr |      47    .1623403
       w |      47    .1644993

'w' is Kendall's W without accounting for tied rankings.
'wcorr' is Kendall's W with corrections for tied rankings.

Because there are numerous observations, wcorr is converted to a
chi-sqrd variable:

.1653403*32*45=233.77 (with 45 degrees of freedom)

Probablity that the rankings are independent of each other is
smaller than .005.
