 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2375
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0365. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine G is 2000

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 14.9630. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0365

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

COMMENT:

  Hermitage has very small production, some say La Chapelle is 5,000 cases a 
  year. So the representation of vintages we sampled would together make the case   
  production of a single Bordeaux chateau and despite protestations by      
  many wine writers, these wines may not be as reliably long-lived as the  
  Bordeaux chateaux to which they are compared.  A comparison of our       
  last gasting of these wines in year <a href="http://www.liquidasset.com/report150.html">2011</a> leads to the following con-     
  clusions. The two tastings overlapped in only three wines: 1979,1985 and 1990. In 
  this present tasting, all three of these wines were ranked less highly than at the
  earlier tasting, including the 1990, the only wine in the group to receive a rating of
  100 from Robert Parker. The consensus of the group was that its overall reaction   
  to this celebrated producer was one of disappointment. One taster however 
  suggested that the absence of wines from 1978, 1989 and 1995, combined  
  with at least two non-representative bottles (1990 and 1996) may have     
  resulted in a skewed assessment. On the evidence, there as not much difference between
  the oldest and the youngest four wines: their rank sums were 165 and 169 respectively.
  In the opinion of some members, wine H suffered from wine making flaw. This flaw is the presence 
  of mercaptans. In the opinion of sseveral people present,  the 1990 sample was      
  oxidized (the most famous wine in the group). These wines were served   
  with home made foie gras, a perfect foil for any red wine. Our finishing  
  wine provided by an English member of the group, was the 1978 Jaboulet Crozes Hermitage
  Thalabert. Robin Yapp sold this wine to our English member and it is quite fantastic today.
