Frank Vannerson, a long time contributor to this web site, died from complications of metastatic colon 
cancer on March 1, 2008. </p>
<p>Vannerson's contributions to wine scholarship will be familiar to those who scan 
the tasting notes on this web site, appearing simply under the moniker of "Frank." Frank was the guiding 
spirit in the formation of the tasting group whose notes appear <a href="rep.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p> He is also well known among wine 
economists for his <a href="vannerson.pdf">paper</a> demonstrating that the alleged American boycott of French wines during the run up 
to the Iraq War had no actual effect on the American consumption of French wines. Most analysts had 
ignored the well known seasonal effect in French wine sales shares and drawn an incorrect conclusion, as 
Vannerson made clear.</P.
<p>Presented at the Vineyard Data Quantification Society meeting to a French audience in 
Dijon, the paper was greeted with genuine astonishment. A subsequest re-working of his data and methods 
confirmed Vannerson's conclusions and appeared in the <a href="http://www.wine-economics.org/journal/"><em>Journal of Wine Economics</em></a> in its Spring 2008 issue. 
</p>
<p>

A memorial service is scheduled for 4:30pm on April 1, 2008 in Richardson Auditorium in Alexander Hall on 
the Princeton University campus. </p>
