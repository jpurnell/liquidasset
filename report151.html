<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0921
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.7366. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.
<br>
 The correlation I measures the degree to which the identification of each 
 judge is correlated with the truth. Here a 1.0 means that the judge identified
 the wines perfectly, and a 0 means that he identified none of them.

<br>
<br>
 Next, we show the correlation among the wine identifications of the judges,
 which also ranges between 1.0 and 0.0:
<br>
     C = 0.6667
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large: > 10%. Most people would say that unless this probability
 is less than 0.1, the judges' identifications are not highly related.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine B is Clos de la Bolliataz 2009         
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine E is Furmint Royal Tokaji              
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine A is Mer et`Soleil Chardonnay 2007     
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine D is C&eacute;leste Saint Joseph 2008         
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine F is Quinta de Muradella               
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine C is Cuma  2009                        

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  2.7619. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.7366

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The objective of this winetasting was to get a wide cross section of grapes that were
  used to make these wines. The wines were arranged into three flights, since it was deemed
  difficult to cope with tasting 18 wines in a single flight. The division of the 18 wines 
  into the three flights was not based on any scientific principles.
  
  One wine had some residual sugar and at least one person loved it      
  and one person did not. It turned out to be the unoaked California 
  chardonnay. These wines were all of high quality and which you would want to drink would depend
  on what you are eating and where you are eating it. There was basically a 
  bipolar distribuition by which three people liked the driest and least       
  fruity wines and the other three preferred the fruiter ones.

 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2476
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1907. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.
<br>
 The correlation I measures the degree to which the identification of each 
 judge is correlated with the truth. Here a 1.0 means that the judge identified
 the wines perfectly, and a 0 means that he identified none of them.

<br>
<br>
 Next, we show the correlation among the wine identifications of the judges,
 which also ranges between 1.0 and 0.0:
<br>
     C = 0.4667
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large: > 10%. Most people would say that unless this probability
 is less than 0.1, the judges' identifications are not highly related.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  7.4286. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1907

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

 COMMENT:

  In this tasting we had one oxidized wine, namely the one rated last.   
  The high quality riesling, though not significant, was the highest       
  scorer along with wine B,from the C&ocirc;te de Ventoux.

 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which

 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0808. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

 COMMENT:

  The clear winner was the sauvignong blanc, but close behind was the    
  Pannonhalmi Tr1eicollis.
