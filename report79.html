 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0952
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.7214. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine I is 2000
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine H is 1991
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine F is 1999
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine A is 1990
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine D is 1998
  6.   tied for  6th place    Wine C is 1986
  7.   tied for  6th place    Wine B is 1994
  8.   ........  8th place    Wine G is 1993
  9.   ........  9th place    Wine E is 1995

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  5.3333. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.7214

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

                           Pairwise Rank Correlations

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.70 for significance at the 0.05
level and must exceed  0.60 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Four of the wines in this tasting also appeared in a tasting of Chateau de Beaucastel
  in <a href="report54.html">April of 2002</a>. In that tasting, the four wines were ranked 1991, 1994,
  1990, 1995. In this tasting, they were ranked 1991, 1990, 1994, 1995.
  Clearly, among the wines ranked on both occasions, the 1991 is superior.
  In fact, it came out first in the earlier tasting and second in this
  tasting, suggesting it is an extraordinary wine. This is completely
  contrary to what most wine writers claim is the case for the 1991
  vintage. This group generally preferred the younger over the older
  wines, which is contrary to conventional wisdom. The one exception was
  the outstanding 1991, which was first in our prior tasting and second
  in this one. It should be noted that Beaucastel goes to sleep for
  decades. Thus, the 1998, which is tasting very well today, may next be
  at this level in 2008.
