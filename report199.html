 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1759
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2812. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  8.6190. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.2812

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Today's tasting was one of the few we have ever had devoted to (mostly) Malbecs.
  The highest rated wine was a bordaux blend with 25% Malbec. All of the wines except one 
  were from Mendoza, with one from Patagonia. These wines are big and tough wines
  and the perception of the group was that age softened the wines. Big    
  fruit and a lot of tannin. And the preception of the group was that age    
  ameliorated some of these characteriastfics and made the wines more       
  approachable. The number one wine was the oldest wine in the tasting.    
  Wine Pie de Malo, many felt, was oxidized and ranked last     
  in the tasting.  One member of the group expressed the concern that     
  some of the malbecs have a petroleum taste. 
  
  What is the difference within the three Catena Zapata wines and within the two Fabre 
  Montmayou wines? While we cannot judge statistical significance withing these two groups,
  it seems fair to say that the differences are not consequential: the three Catena Zapata wines
  3rd, 5th and 6th respectively, while the two Fabre Montmayous are 4th and 7th.
