  <p>   In this paper we show that the quality of the vintage for red
Bordeaux wines, as judged by the prices of mature wines, can be
predicted by the weather during the growing season that produced
the wines.  Red Bordeaux wines have been produced in the same place
and in much the same way for hundreds of years.  When young, the
wines from the best vineyards are astringent, and many people find
them unpleasant to consume.  As these wines age they lose their
astringency and many people find them very pleasant to consume.
Because Bordeaux wines taste better when they are older, there is
an incentive to store the young wines until they are mature.  As a
result, there is an active market in young wines (similar to &quot;new
issues&quot; in the securities markets) and an active market in older
wines (similar to the secondary markets in securities).</p>
<p>     Surprisingly, the weather information that is so useful in
predicting the prices of the mature wines plays little or no role
in setting the prices of the young wines.  We show that young wines
are usually over-priced relative to what we would predict based on
the weather and the price of the old wines.  As the young wines
age, however, their prices usually converge to our predictions.
This implies that &quot;bad&quot; vintages are over-priced when they are
young, and that &quot;good&quot; vintages may sometimes be under-priced when
they are young.  Rational buyers should avoid bad vintages when
they are young, but they may sometimes wish to purchase good
vintages.</p>
 <p>    Although the evidence suggests that the market for older wines
is relatively efficient, it implies that the market for younger
wines is very inefficient.  Why don't the purchasers of young wines
wait and buy them when they are mature?  And why do purchasers
ignore the weather that produced the vintage in making their
decisions?  Although there are no simple answers to these
questions, we discuss one possible explanation in the final section
of this paper.</p>

         <center><b>1.  Vineyards and Vintages</b></center>

<p>     The best wines of Bordeaux are made from grapes grown on
specific plots of land and the wine is named after the property (or
chateau) where the grapes are grown.  In fact, knowledge of the
chateau and vintage provides most of the information about the
quality of the wine.  That is, if we imagine 10 vintages and 6
chateaux, there are, in principle, 60 different wines of different
quality.  However, knowing the reputations of the 6 chateaux and
the 10 vintages is sufficient to determine the quality of all 60
wines.  That is, good vintages produce good wines in all vineyards
and the best wines in each vintage are usually produced by the best
vineyards.</p>
<p>     Although this point is sometimes denied by those who produce
the wines, and especially by those who sell the young wines, it is
easy to establish its truth by reference to the prices of the
mature wines.  To demonstrate the point, Table 1 indicates the
current market price in London of 6 Bordeaux chateaux from the 10
vintages from 1960-1969.</p><br><br><img src="table1.jpg" border=2 
alt=""><br><br><p> These chateaux were selected because they
are large producers and their wines appear frequently in the
secondary (auction) markets.  (A blank in the table indicates that
the wine has not appeared in the market recently.  Lower quality
vintages are typically the first to leave the market.)  The
vintages from 1960-1969 are selected because, by the 1990s, these
wines are fully mature and there is little remaining uncertainty
about their quality.</p>
 <p>    From the table it is obvious that knowledge of the row means
and the column means is sufficient to predict most of the prices in
the table.  (The explained variance from a regression of the
logarithm of the price on chateau and vintage dummies is over 90%.)
A ranking of the chateaux in order of quality based on their prices
would be Latour, (Lafite, Cheval Blanc), Pichon-Lalande, (Cos
d'Estournel, Montrose).  In fact, as Edmund Penning-Rowsell points
out in his classic book The Wines of Bordeaux, the famous 1855
classification of the chateaux of Bordeaux into quality grades was
based on a similar assessment by price alone.  Surprisingly, the
1855 classification ranks these chateaux in only a slightly
different order:  Lafite, Latour, Pichon-Lalande, Cos d'Estournel,
and Montrose.  (Cheval Blanc was not ranked in 1855.)  Likewise, a
ranking of the quality of the vintages based on price alone would
be 1961, 1966, (1962, 1964), 1967.  The remaining vintages (1960,
1963, 1965, 1968, 1969) would be ranked inferior to these 5, but,
perhaps because of this fact, many of the wines from these inferior
vintages are no longer sold in the secondary market.</p>


<center> <b>2.  Real Rate of Return to Holding Bordeaux Wine</b></center>

<p>     It is natural to ask why the prices of mature wines from a
single chateau, made in the same way from grapes grown in the same
place by the same winemaker, would differ so dramatically from
vintage to vintage, as is indicated by Table 1.  There are two
obvious explanations for this vintage variability.  First, the
older wines have been held longer, and so they must bear a normal
rate of return.  This fact alone would make the older wines more
expensive than the younger ones.  Second, the quality of the wines
of different vintages may vary because the quality of the grapes
used to make the wines varies.</p>
<p>     Figure 1 provides a test of the hypothesis that the price of
the wines varies because of their age.  In this figure (and
throughout the remainder of the paper) we use as a measure of the
price of a vintage an index based on the wines of several chateaux.
The chateaux are deliberately selected to represent the most
expensive wines (Lafite, Latour, Margaux, Cheval Blanc) as well as
a selection of wines that are less expensive (Ducru Beaucaillou,
Leoville Las Cases, Palmer, Pichon Lalande, Beychevelle, Cos
d'Estournel, Giscours, Gruaud-Larose, and Lynch-Bages).<br><br><img src="fig1.jpg" border=2 alt=""><br><br>  We
construct the index of vintage price from a regression of the
logarithm of the price from several thousand auction sales on dummy
variables indicating the chateau and the vintages.  (The precise
composition of the sample has very little effect on the results.)
The regression coefficients for the vintage dummies are then used
to construct the vintage index.  This provides a simple way to
construct a vintage index in the presence of an unbalanced sample
design.  (We compute the antilogarithm of these coefficients and
then express the price relative to the index price for 1961.  This
is merely a convenient normalization and affects only the intercept
in the regressions reported below.)</p>
<p>  Figure 1 is a scatter diagram of the logarithm of the price of
the wines of a vintage against the vintage year.  (The vintages of
1954 and 1956 are not plotted, as these wines are now rarely sold.
These two vintages are generally considered to be the poorest in
their decade.)  It is apparent from the diagram that there is a
negatively inclined relationship.  The slope of the regression line
through these points is -.035.  This is an estimate of (the
negative of) what economists sometimes call the real product rate
of return to holding Bordeaux wines.  A &quot;real product rate of
return&quot; is a number such that its reciprocal indicates how many
bottles of wine one would have to keep in the cellar in order to be
able to consume one bottle per year in perpetuity.  These data
indicate that it would be necessary to have about 28 bottles in a
perpetual cellar that was intended to support the consumption of 1
bottle per year.  With a cellar of this size the proceeds from the
sale of the older vintages would be just sufficient to restock the
cellar and provide the consumption of one bottle.  Since it is
denominated in bottles of wine rather than dollars, this measure
does not tell us what the return to holding wine denominated in
generalized purchasing power (money) is.</p>
<p>     We have analyzed the relationship between the (log) price of
Bordeaux wine and its age for many individual chateaux.  So long as
sample includes at least 20 vintages, we invariably obtain a
negative slope to this relationship of around -.03.  It is notable
that the study of the various vintages of wine provides so reliable
and simple a measure of the real rate of return.  As we shall see,
most of the remaining variation in the price of the wine of
different vintages is due to variation from vintage to vintage in
the weather that produced the grapes.</p>


<center><b>3.  Vintages and the Weather</b></center>

<p>     It is well known that the quality of any fruit, in general,
depends on the weather during the growing season that produced the
fruit.  What is not so widely understood, is that in some
localities the weather will vary dramatically from one year to the
next.  In California, for example, it never rains in the summer,
and it is always warm in the summer.  There is a simple reason for
this.  In California a high pressure weather system settles each
summer over the California coast and produces a warm, dry growing
season for the grapes planted there.  In Bordeaux this sometimes
happens--but usually it does not.  Great vintages for Bordeaux
wines correspond to the years in which August and September are
dry, the growing season is warm, and the previous winter has been
wet.</p>
<p>     Figure 2 establishes that it is hot, dry summers that produce
the vintages in which the mature wines obtain the higher prices.
This figure displays for each vintage the summer temperature from
low to high as you move from left to right, and the harvest rain
from low to high as you move from top to bottom.  Vintages that
sell for an above average price are displayed in dark shading, and
vintages that sell for a below average price are displayed in light
shading. <br><br><img src="fig2.jpg" border=2 alt=""><br><br> If the weather is the key determinant of wine quality,
then the dark points should be in the northeast quadrant of the
diagram and the light points should be in the southwest quadrant of
the diagram.  It is apparent that this is precisely the case.  Even
anomalies, like the 1973 vintage, tend to corroborate the fact that
the weather determines the quality of the wines.  The wines of this
vintage, which are of somewhat above average quality, have always
sold at relatively low prices; insiders know that they are often
bargains.</p>
<p>     Table 2 contains a regression of the (log) price of the
vintage on the age of the vintage and the weather variables
indicated.  In practice, the weather variables are almost
uncorrelated with each other and with the age of the vintage. 
<img src="table2.jpg" border=2 align="left" hspace=8 vspace=6 alt=""> As
a result, the regression equation is remarkably robust to the
addition of other variables.  The second row of the table contains
the basic &quot;Bordeaux equation,&quot; while the third row shows the effect
on the regression of adding the temperature in September as an
additional variable.  It is obvious that this variable does not
have a statistically significant coefficient and, indeed, in
further experimentation we have not found any other statistically
significant variables to add to the regression.</p>
<p>     It is possible, of course, to predict the relative price at
which the new vintage should be sold as soon as the growing season
is complete.  In fact, we have been doing this for several years
and publishing the results in the newsletter LIQUID ASSETS:  The
International Guide to Fine Wines.  The basic idea for these
predictions is displayed in Figure 3.  Here we have added to Figure
2 the data for the vintages from 1981-1992.  Two things are
immediately apparent from the figure.  First, all but one of these
recent vintages (1986) was produced by a growing season that was
warmer than what is historically &quot;normal.&quot;  It is no accident that
many Europeans believe global warming may already be here!  This
unusual run of extraordinary weather has almost certainly resulted
in a huge quantity of excellent, but immature red Bordeaux wine.
<br><br><img src="fig3.jpg" border=2 alt=""><br><br>
     Second, the weather that created the vintages of 1989 and 1990
appears to be quite exceptional by any standard.  Is it appropriate
to predict that the wines of these vintages will be of outstanding
quality when the temperature that produced them is so far outside
the normal range?  Before making the prediction for 1989 we did, in
fact, turn to Professor Lincoln Moses (of Stanford University) for
informal advice.  Moses suggested two informal tests.  (a)  Would
the last major &quot;out of sample&quot; prediction have been correct?  The
idea here is to use the past to indirectly test the ability of the
relationship to stretch beyond the available data.  In fact, the
last major &quot;out of sample&quot; prediction for which all uncertainty has
been resolved is the vintage of 1961, which had the lowest August-
September rainfall in Bordeaux history.  Just as the unusual
weather predicted, the market (see Table 1), and most wine lovers,
have come to consider this an outstanding vintage.  (b)  Is the
warmth of the 1989 and 1990 growing seasons in Bordeaux greater
than the normal warmth in other places where similar grapes are
grown?  The idea here is to determine whether the temperature in
Bordeaux is abnormal by comparison with grape growing regions that
may be even warmer.  In fact, the temperature in 1989 or 1990 in
Bordeaux was no higher than the average temperature in the Barossa
Valley of South Australia or the Napa Valley in California, places
where high quality red wines are made from similar grape types.</p>
     Based on these two informal tests, we are convinced that both
the 1989 and 1990 vintages in Bordeaux are likely to be
outstanding.  Many wine writers have made the same predictions in
the trade magazines.  Of course, it is still too early to determine
whether the wines will fulfill their promise.

<center>                     <b>4.  Market Inefficiency</b></center>

 <p>    It is natural to inquire as to the prices at which the wines
listed in Table 1 were sold when the wines were first offered on
the market.  In particular, were the relative prices of the young
wines good forecasts of the relative prices the mature wines now
fetch?  It is difficult to answer this question because the young
wines were all sold in different time periods and at prices that
are not generally known.  Instead, we have explored a closely
related question:  Were the relative prices of the vintages when
they were first sold in the auction market good forecasts of the
relative prices of the mature wines?  And were the prices of the
young wines, viewed as forecasts of the prices of the mature wines,
as good as the predictions made using the data on the weather
alone?</p>
<p>     Table 3 reveals the answer to both of these questions.  In
this table we have listed, for each calendar year from 1971-1989,
the price of the portfolio of wines from each vintage relative to
the price of the portfolio of wines from the 1961, 1962, 1964, and
1966 vintages. <br><br><img src="table3b.jpg" border=2 alt=""><br><br> The benchmark vintage portfolio is a simple average
of the 1961, 1962, 1964 and 1966 vintage indexes.  The second
column gives the value of the benchmark portfolio in pounds
sterling in the year indicated, and provides a general measure of
the overall inflation in wine prices in the London auction markets.
The entries for each of the vintages in the remaining columns are
simply ratios of the prices of the wines in each vintage to the
benchmark portfolio in column 1 of the table.  The 1961, 1962,
1964, and 1966 vintages were selected for the benchmark because the
weather data in Figure 2 predict they would be good, and the wines
from these vintages are, no doubt as a consequence, still widely
traded.  The vintages that are studied in the table include all
those between 1961 and 1972.  Listed in the bottom row of the table
is the predicted relative price of the vintage as taken from the
&quot;Bordeaux equation&quot; in Table 2.</p>
 <p>    The data in Table 3 confirm two remarkable facts.  First, most
of these older vintages began their lives in the auction markets at
prices which are far above what they will ultimately fetch.  For
example, the bottom row of the tables indicates that, based on the
weather, the wines of a vintage like 1967 would have been expected
to sell for about one-half the price of an average of the wines
from the 1961, 1962, 1964 and 1966 vintages.  In fact, the wines
entered the auction markets in 1972 at about 50% more than
expected, and slowly drifted down in relative price over the years.
Second, the predicted prices from the &quot;Bordeaux equation,&quot; which is
fit from an entirely different set of data, are remarkably good
indicators of the prices at which the mature wines will ultimately
trade.</p>
 <p>    One interesting way to see the inefficiency in this market is
to compare the prices of the vintages of 1962, 1964, 1967, and 1969
in calendar year 1972.  As the weather data in Figure 2 indicate,
and the prediction in the bottom row of Table 3 confirms, we should
have expected (in 1972) that the 1962 and 1964 vintages would sell
for considerably more than the vintages of both 1967 and 1969.  In
fact, in 1972 these four vintages fetched nearly identical prices,
in sharp contrast to what the weather would have indicated.  By
around 1979 the prices of the 1969s and 1967s had fallen to around
what would have been predicted from the weather.</p>
<p>     It is apparent from Table 3 that most vintages are &quot;over-
priced&quot; when the wines are first offered on the auction market and
that this state of affairs often persists for ten years or more
following the year of the vintage.  The over-pricing of the
vintages is especially apparent for those vintages which, from the
weather, we would predict are the poorest.  This suggests that, in
large measure, the ability of the weather to predict the quality of
the wines is ignored by the early purchasers of the wines.</p>
<p>     An interesting recent example of this phenomenon is the 1986
vintage.  As Figure 3 indicates, this is a vintage that, based on
the weather, we should expect to be &quot;average.&quot;  Compared to the
other vintages of the last decade, this vintage should fetch a
considerably lower price.  In fact, the vintage was launched with
great fanfare as among the finest two vintages of the decade.  The
wines were sold at similar, and sometimes higher, prices to initial
buyers than the wines of the other vintages of the past decade.
The enthusiasm for these wines has dampened somewhat because they
have not fetched auction prices higher than those of the other
vintages in the decade.  We should expect that, in due course, the
prices of these wines will decline relative to the prices of most
of the other vintages of the 1980s.</p>


                        <div align="center"><b> 5.  Conclusion</b></div>

 <p>   Why does the market for immature red Bordeaux wines appear to
be so inefficient when the market for mature wines appears to be so
efficient?  We think there may be several related explanations.
The current Bordeaux marketing system has the character of an
agricultural income stabilization system, and this may be its
purpose.  Complete income stabilization for the growers would
require that the price of the young wines be inversely related to
the quantity produced, and independent of the quality.  Although
the actual pricing of young Bordeaux wines falls short of this
ideal, it is clearly closer to it than would occur if purchasers
used the information available from the weather for determining the
quality of the wines.  The producers do attempt to raise prices
when crops are small, despite the evidence that the quantity of the
wines (determined by the weather in the spring) is generally
unrelated to the quality of the wines.  Moreover, it is common for
the proprietors to claim that each vintage is a good one,
independent of the weather that produced it.  Indeed, there is no
obvious incentive for an individual proprietor to ever claim
anything else!</p>
<p>     A more fundamental question arises about the motives of the
early purchasers of the wines.  Why have they ignored the evidence
that the weather during a grape growing season is a fundamental and
easily measured determinant of the quality of the mature wines?
And will they continue to do so as the evidence for the
predictability of the quality of new vintages accumulates?</p>
