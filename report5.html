 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2099

<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1842. Most analysts would say that unless this
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Comments by Orley Ashenfelter: Everyone agrees extraodrinarily good       
  Barolos, easy to drink today, and every sign they will improve.           
                                                                            
  Ed Bergman: Very focused wines. Rich, with ripe fruit that tends to       
  obscure significant tannins, making the wine luscious to drink now, but   
  the future will be more complex wines.                                    
                                                                            
  Burt Malkiel: The Ceretto was the richest and smoothest of the group.
