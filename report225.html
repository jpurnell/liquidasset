 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3598
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0346. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine H is 2000 La Turque                    
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine F is 2000 La Mouline                   
---------------------------------------------------
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine G is 2001 La Turque                    
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine A is 2005 La Mouline                   
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine E is 2001 La Landonne                  
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine B is 2001 La Mouline                   
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine D is 2005 La Turque                    
---------------------------------------------------
  8.   ........  8th place    Wine C is 2005 La Landonne                  

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 15.1111. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0346

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:
One taster had this to say:

This was a spectacular tasting of the highly rated Guigal La La Cote Roties.
The wines were mature, representing the 2000, 2001 and 2005 vintages.
Overall each wine stood in its own right as delicious, with soft tannins where present.
Despite this, there was a fairly uniform preference for the 2 representative wines of the 2000 vintage.
One question was raised as to whether the 100 point 2005 wines would benefit from more time?
Comparing the combined scores of the 01 versus 05 vintages there did not appear to be a significant difference.
These wines are very collectible and can be reliably depended upon to be delicious if cellared, if you can afford them.                                                    

In general we agreed that these were truly phenomenal wines, b ut in spite of their relative        
  similarity, the taster were sufficiently a ble to distinguish among       
  them to yield statistically significant results. The two top wines  were  
  the 2000 La Mouline an d the 2000 La Turque. While these were rate        
  slightly lowerf by Parker than the 100 point 2005s (95 and 96), they      
  drank better today than the younger wines. This may reflect the group's   
  preference fvcor older wines or, more likely, the fact that these great   
  wines really need a long time to mature.
