     ( 6 is the best possible,  30 is the worst)
<br>
<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.5944
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0065. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.
<br>
 The correlation I measures the degree to which the identification of each 
 judge is correlated with the truth. Here a 1.0 means that the judge identified
 the wines perfectly, and a 0 means that he identified none of them.

       Correlation Between the Ranks of
 Each Person With the Average Ranking of Others
<br>

  Mike                  0.9000         1.0000                                   
  Orley                 0.8000         1.0000                                   
  Bob                   0.7000         1.0000                                   
  Dick                  0.7000         1.0000                                   
  Burt                  0.6000         1.0000                                   
  John                  0.3000         1.0000                                   
                                                                                
                                                                                
<br>
<br>
 Next, we show the correlation among the wine identifications of the judges,
 which also ranges between 1.0 and 0.0:
<br>
     C = 1.0000
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large: > 10%. Most people would say that unless this probability
 is less than 0.1, the judges' identifications are not highly related.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   tied for  1st place    Wine C is Henschke Hill of Grace 1987       
  2.   tied for  1st place    Wine E is Henschke Hill of Grace 1989       
---------------------------------------------------
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine B is Henschke Hill of Grace 1986       
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine D is Henschke Hill of Grace 1988       
---------------------------------------------------
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine A is Henschke Hill of Grace 1985       

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 14.2667. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0065

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.90 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The Henschke "Hill of Grace" are among the most famous wines of Australia. 
  They now sell at prices comparable to Penfold's Grange. These wines were 
  purchased in Australia in the 1990s from several fine faculty club        
  winelists.
                                                                  
  These wines were double decanted and needed it badly because they con-    
  tained a lot of sediment. Also, the corks were typical of Australian      
  wines of this period, i.e., short, and difficult to remove. 
                
  There was overwhelming agreement among the tasters. The wines have an     
  incredibly consistent style. For Australian wines made from the Shiraz    
  grape they are very restrained in style, and have much more in common     
  with the wines of the Northern Rhone than some would expect.              
  They were all wonderful wines and justified their prices.
