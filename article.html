<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#800000">CALIFORNIA'S TOP CABERNET SAUVIGNONS
</FONT></H2>

<P>It was only a few years ago that America's top wine writers were announcing
that mature California cabernets were not worth their storage costs. With
the continued very dramatic growth of Butterfield's San Francisco auctions,
there is now a good supply of mature California cabernet sauvignon arriving
on the market so that buyers can see for them-selves just how well these
wines age. The willingness of buyers to spend hard earned cash for properly
matured California cabernets indicates that these wines deserve a place
in the best wine cellars. </P>

<P>We first constructed a ranking of California's top cabernets seven years
ago. We used a simple, tried and true test to determine our ranking: we
based our ranking on the prices the wines fetched in arm's length transactions
in the auction rooms. Instead of using the size of a winery's advertising
budget, or the ratings of a few wine writers (no doubt influenced by the
same budgets and boondoggles), we rank the wines based on what consumers
are prepared to pay in order to drink the mature wines. This is the method
that was used to construct the original ranking of the top wines of Bordeaux
in 1855. We have developed a new ranking to show the extraordinary changes
that have taken place over the past seven years in California. For one
thing, many of the top wines today (<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Opus I</FONT>,
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Caymus Special Selection</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Dunn
Howell </FONT>In order to make the comparisons we selected a benchmark
wine. As in past years, we selected the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Beaulieu
Vineyards Private Reserve</FONT> as the benchmark wine because it remains
the most commonly sold mature premium California wine. We expressed the
price of every other producer's wine as a percentage of the price of a
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">BV Private Reserve </FONT>from the same vintage.</P>

<P>Only wines from the 1985 vintage or earlier were used in our comparisons.
Using the wines from later vintages runs the risk of confusing the hype
that some winemakers generate with the quality of the wine they make. Our
ranking is based entirely on the hard test of the market place for mature
wines.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#800000">Results of the Ranking: Changes
at the Very Top</FONT></H3>

<P>The results of the ranking reveal some remarkable new entrants at very
high prices. Four years ago there were only a half dozen wines that sold
at higher prices than the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">BV Private Reserve</FONT>
cabernet sauvignon. Today there are 17 wines that sell at such lofty prices.
On the other hand, the number of cabernets that sell steadily at prices
lower than a BV Private Reserve has remained relatively constant. It would
be tempting to suggest that the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">BV Private Reserve</FONT>
has slipped, but a look at our price listings shows that this is not the
case. The benchmark <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">BV Private Reserve</FONT> cabernet
simply has much more competition at the top end of the market.</P>

<P>At the top of the list, and far ahead of any competitor, is the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Caymus
Special</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Selection</FONT>. This limited production
wine is in such demand that most retailers allocate it only to top customers.
In a small, elite group next on the list are the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Opus
I</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Stag's Leap Cask 23</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Dunn
Howell Mountain</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Heitz Martha's Vineyard</FONT>.
A third group of super-premium wines includes the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Spottswoode</FONT>,
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Ridge Monte Bello</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Silver
Oak Napa</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Dunn Napa</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Beringer
Reserve Napa</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Chateau Montelena Napa</FONT>,
and <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Dominus Napa</FONT> wines. A final group of the
top wines clusters close to the benchmark <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">BV Private
Reserve </FONT>and includes the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Silver Oak Alexander
Valley</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Joseph Phelps Insignia</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Forman
Napa</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Robert Mondavi Reserve</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Heitz
Bella Oaks</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Duckhorn Napa</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Caymus,
Estate Napa</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Groth Napa</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Macayamas</FONT>,
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Stag's Leap SLV</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Jordan</FONT>
cabernets. Selling for less than the benchmark <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">BV
Private Reserve</FONT> cabernet is a group of wines with a good track record
for aging. These wines include vintages of the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Sterling
Reserve </FONT>wines from the 1970s, as well as the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Freemark
Abbey Bosche</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Clos du</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Val</FONT>,
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Heitz, Ridge</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Joseph
Phelps</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Robert Mondavi,</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Charles
Krug Vintage Select</FONT> cabernets. Mature samples of these wines often
make outstanding bargains when bought at the auctions. They also tend to
be reasonably priced when they are first released. As a result, these wines
make useful additions to the cellar of any wine lover who intends to drink
his or her purchases.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#800000">Thinning of the Ranks in the Moderate
Price Categories</FONT></H3>

<P>As the above data demonstrate, the ranks of high quality cabernets meant
for long maturation have been quite dramatically thinned out in the lower
price ranges. As many lovers of California cabernet sauvignon have learned
in the last decade, it has become very hard to find a high quality cabernet
made for long maturation at a price below $25 per bottle. We think that
the less visible wineries with long term track records are the best places
to find wines for laying down today. Unfortunately, the wineries from this
group have either been forced to increase their public relations and marketing
budgets or drop by the sidelines. To some observers this is a serious comment
on the structure of the fine wine industry in Napa. Ironically, the scale
of the top wineries is typically very small, with production of about 2,000-4,000
cases being typical for most of the top wines. This is a dramatic difference
from the development in Bordeaux, where there are literally hundreds of
producers who market 10,000-15,000 cases of wine made for long maturation
at prices below $20 per bottle in the US market. From these data it appears
that the Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon brands have tended to fragment
into two increasingly widening groups. One group contains three dozen wines
that are produced in very small quantities and marketed at full retail
prices above $30 per bottle. The second group consists of wines that are
produced on a large scale, made for early consumption, and that sell for
$10 or less per bottle. </P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#800000">Role of the Winemaker: Dunn, Forman,
Venge, Wagner</FONT></H3>

<P>As we studied the results of our new ranking of California cabernets
it became clear that the role of the winemaker was uniquely important in
the development of most of the highly ranked new wines. We think a crucial
factor in the development of top cabernets is the necessity of making wines
that do not flatter early. In California's &quot;show biz&quot; wine industry
it is all too rare for a winemaker to take the long hard road to success
by concentrating on the quality of the wine in the face of the barrage
of continuous, uninformed criticism offered by the world's wine press.
Although wine making style is of importance, we also think there is more
involved. The top Napa winemakers know where to find the finest grapes,
and they are prepared to pay for them.</P>

<P>An interesting example of this phenomenon is <FONT COLOR="#008000">Nils
Venge</FONT>, a name that insiders in Napa know well, who has never had
his own name on the outstanding wines he has made. <FONT COLOR="#008000">Venge</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">
</FONT>established his reputation by making outstanding cabernets for <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Villa
Mt. Eden</FONT> in the vintages of the 1970s. The <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Villa
Mt. Eden</FONT> wines from these vintages still show up in the auctions
and we have found that they continue to make delicious drinking. (Recent
samples of the 1976, 1977, 1978, and 1979 <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Villa Mt.
Eden</FONT> cabernets tasted in the past year were all excellent.) As if
to test the importance of the role of the winemaker, <FONT COLOR="#008000">Venge</FONT>
moved on to <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Groth</FONT> in the early 1980s. Now,
more than a decade later, <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Groth</FONT>'s regular
Napa vintages from the 1980s have entered the ranks of California's age-worthy
cabernet sauvignons at prices only a little below those of a <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">BV
Private Reserve</FONT>. <FONT COLOR="#008000">Venge</FONT> recently moved
again, leaving<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"> Groth</FONT>, to work with the Robert
Keenan winery. Will <FONT COLOR="#008000">Nils Venge</FONT> have the same
effect on Robert Keenan's wines?</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Randy Dunn</FONT> is another outstanding winemaker
who has shown what can be done with Napa cabernet sauvignon. <FONT COLOR="#008000">Dunn</FONT>'s
eponymous <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Napa</FONT> and <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Howell
Mountain</FONT> cabernets sell at auction for prices 42% and 115% higher
than the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">BV Private Reserve</FONT>. Dunn's first
vintage, in 1979, was sold by mailing list for about $10 per bottle. Although
<FONT COLOR="#008000">Dunn</FONT>'s wines clearly improve steadily with
bottle age, recent samples have shown that the wines drink beautifully
when they reach about ten years of age. In fact,<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#008000">Dunn</FONT> did not spring suddenly onto the
Napa scene; he worked first for <FONT COLOR="#008000">Charlie Wagner</FONT>,
the founder of Caymus, whose <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Caymus Special Selection</FONT>
has now become the most expensive wine in California. <FONT COLOR="#008000">Wagner</FONT>'s
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Caymus Estate</FONT> cabernet sauvignon has long
been highly regarded, and it has been a staple of the California wine scene
since it was first marketed in the 1970s. Like <FONT COLOR="#008000">Dunn</FONT>,
Caymus currently has two different wines that appear in our list of California's
top cabernets. In fact, the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Caymus Estate</FONT>
cabernet has been phased out in favor of a &quot;Napa&quot; bottling that
comes, in part, from purchased grapes. Recent bottles of the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Caymus
Napa</FONT> cabernet that we have tasted have continued to be outstanding,
but it remains to be seen whether the Napa bottling from this winery will
retain its cachet. Although <FONT COLOR="#008000">Forman</FONT>'s cabernet
sauvignon now fetches high prices in the US auctions, winemaker <FONT COLOR="#008000">Ric
Forman</FONT> produced the outstanding wines at <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Sterling
Vineyard</FONT> in the 1970s long before moving on to establish his own
winery. We have recently bought and tasted through the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Sterling
Reserve</FONT> wines of the 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, and 1977 vintages.
All of the wines remain firm, delicious examples of Napa cabernet. Although
<FONT COLOR="#008000">Forman</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">'</FONT>s wines
do not have the flamboyant style of some other California cabernets, they
are built to last.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#800000">The Longest Track Records: Draper,
Heitz, Phelps, and Winiarski</FONT></H3>

<P>A second group of winemakers has a longer track record in making and
marketing California's top cabernets. Ridge, Heitz, Phelps, and Stag's
Leap Wine Cellars are now among the old established names of California.
The top wine from each of these wineries has been a fixture in our list
of California's top cabernets from the very beginning. Behind each winery
is a familiar name, a long track record, and a portfolio of wines meant
to be sold at several price levels.</P>

<P>Ridge Vineyard's <FONT COLOR="#008000">Paul Draper</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">
</FONT>produces one of the few top cabernets that doesn't come from Napa.
The <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Ridge Monte Bello</FONT> is made from fruit grown
near the winery in the Santa Cruz Mountains overlooking San Francisco Bay.
Wines like the 1981 Ridge <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Monte Bello</FONT>, tasted
twice in the past year, make ideal drinking now. Occasionally the grapes
on the Monte Bello ridge do not fully ripen. In these vintages the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Ridge
Monte Bello</FONT> has an herbal, unripe character and is often de-classified.
This is the reason we suspect that cool years, like 1980 and 1982, which
produced acceptable wines in Napa, produced the weaker <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Ridge
Monte Bello</FONT> vintages. Bargain hunters should keep a look out for
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Ridge's York Creek</FONT> cabernet, which sells for
about one-third the price of the Monte Bello and is a consistently well
made wine produced from Napa fruit.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Joe Heitz </FONT>and his family virtually wrote
the book on high quality Napa cabernet sauvignon. The Heitz Martha's, from
fruit produced by <FONT COLOR="#008000">Tom and Martha May</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">'</FONT>s
vineyard, is a standard bearer for Napa cabernets made in the 1970s. (The
1974 <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Heitz Martha</FONT>'s still stands out as the
wine of the decade for many cabernet lovers.) The <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Heitz
Bella Oaks</FONT> cabernet, made only since 1976, is a personal favorite,
as it provides an outstanding, reliable cabernet at a very reasonable price.
Many of these wines are still sold from the Heitz mailing list; if you
are looking for larger sized bottles, call the winery to make sure you
are on the list. </P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Joseph Phelps</FONT>, a neighbor of Heitz, has
produced outstanding wines from (designated) grapes grown at the Backus
and Eisele Vineyards. However, the Phelps standard bearer is the proprietary
wine labeled Insignia, and it has shown up regularly at auction since we
began to keep records. A powerful cabernet, with an outstanding track record,
the 1974 <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Insignia</FONT>, tasted recently, remains
a fine example of the vintage. The regular bottlings of the Phelps cabernets
from the vintages of the 1970s still show up in the auction rooms, and
they make outstanding drinking at very reasonable prices.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#008000">Warren Winiarksi</FONT> is a different story altogether.
With an academic background in the humanities, <FONT COLOR="#008000">Winiarski</FONT>
has had profound success making soft, silky wines that surprise collectors
by both their depth and longevity. <FONT COLOR="#008000">Winiarski</FONT>'s
Stag's Leap Wine Cellars produces the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Stag's Leap
Vineyard</FONT> and the <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Cask 23</FONT> bottlings,
both of which have appeared in all our rankings of California's outstanding
cabernets.</P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#800000">Where to Buy (and Where to Sell)
Mature California Cabernets</FONT></H3>

<P>In the last year the auction sale of wine has spread to New York. We
were very curious to learn whether the prices of California's top cabernets
would be the same in New York as in San Francisco. We therefore compared
the prices of California wines sold at Butterfields in San Francisco with
the prices of the same wines sold at Davis &amp; Co. in Chicago, Morrell's
in New York, Sotheby's/Sherry Lehman in New York, and Christie's/Zachy's
in New York. We were surprised by the results.</P>

<P>First, over one-half of all mature California cabernet sauvignon wines
sold in the U.S. are sold at Butterfields in San Francisco. In short, the
entire total of the California wines sold at the other auction houses is
smaller than the Butterfields total. Second, the prices of the California
wines sold in New York and Chicago range between 65% (Sotheby's) and 85%
(Christie's) of the prices the same wines fetch in San Francisco (Butterfields).
Here is our advice: To get the best prices sell your California wines in
San Francisco. If you are looking for bargains, bid on the relatively small
number of California wines offered in the catalogues of the Chicago and
New York auction houses. </P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#800000">Our Advice on Buying California
Cabernets </FONT></H3>

<P>Sophisticated wine lovers everywhere are becoming familiar with California's
top wines. We think every wine lover should have some of California's top
wines in the cellar, if only to show visitors what is being produced. If
you are primarily interested in drinking the wines you buy, as we are,
here is our advice: </P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Stick to wines from the Napa and Alexander Valleys</B>. Although
a few wines from the Sonoma appellation have entered our list of top wines,
just as many have departed. The one really successful California red wine
made for long maturation is Napa cabernet--why accept substitutes? </LI>

<LI><B>Many new wineries enter into production before their vineyards are
mature</B>. Mature samples from these early vintages will have an herbal,
unripe character that comes from immature vines. Wait until a winery has
mature vines before you cellar their wines.</LI>

<LI><B>Consider buying wines from under-rated producers</B> like <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Mayacamas</FONT>,
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Clos du Val</FONT>, and <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Burgess</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Cellars</FONT>. These wineries have fine track records,
but they don't get the hype that is needed to boost prices. Consider also
buying the merely &quot;regular&quot; bottlings from reliable producers
like <FONT COLOR="#008000">Robert Mondavi</FONT>.</LI>

<LI><B>Here is a real insiders' tip</B>. Cabernets bottled by Villa Mt.
Eden and Sterling in the vintages of the 1970s often make fabulous bargains
in the wine auctions. We think we know why: most wine lovers have forgotten
that these wines were made by two of California's most famous winemakers!</LI>

<LI><B>Look carefully through the</B> <BLINK><FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">LIQUID
ASSETS</FONT></BLINK> <B>price listings</B> and you will find many examples
where mature samples of older California cabernets sell for prices at auction
that are lower than the prices of immature wines offered by retailers.
It makes no sense to buy immature wines at prices higher than the prices
mature wines fetch at the auctions. </LI>
</UL>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT COLOR="#800000">A Final Note on Vintages</FONT>
</H3>

<P>In our study of California cabernet auction prices we noticed some variability
in the prices the wines fetch in different vintages. However, it is important
to recognize that, while it may exist, the role of vintage variability
is far smaller in California than it is in Europe. There is a simple reason
for this: The weather in Napa varies far less from year to year than it
does in Europe. At this time we do not believe it is known how the characteristics
of a California growing season affect the variability in the quality of
the vintages.</P>

<P>Judging by price alone, the vintages of 1968 and 1970 stand out as the
best in the last three decades. Among the vintages of the 1970s, the 1974s
and 1978s fetch the highest prices. Wines from the vintages of 1973, 1975,
1976, 1977, and 1979 all sell for about the same prices, while the 1974s
typically sell for around twice as much. The 1978s sell for about 60% of
the 1974s, or 20% more than the wines from the other vintages in the 1970s.
An example of how little is known about California vintage variability
is provided by the 1980 vintage.</P>

<P>Old timers will recall that the 1980 California cabernets were hyped
as outstanding when first offered over a decade ago. The 1980 growing season
was one of the coolest on record and, at the time, it was widely believed
that high temperatures caused excessive ripening that might cause a problem
for the production of Napa cabernet. In fact, today the wines from the
1980 vintage are no longer considered outstanding and they sell for less
than the wines from the 1979 and 1984 vintages, both of which featured
much warmer growing seasons. As the history of the 1980 vintage demonstrates,
it is still not yet known what features, if any, of the California growing
season affect the quality of the wines.</P>

<P>Among more recent years, the 1985s fetch the highest prices, about 60%
of the 1974s. The other vintages of the 1980s, ranked in order from highest
to lowest by their prices, are 1984, 1982, 1981, and 1983. Undoubtedly
much of the concern over vintage variability in California cabernet is
based on a misguided comparison with what is expected from Europe. Many
bargains have appeared in the retail pipeline as the wines from the widely
dismissed 1988 and 1989 vintages appear at heavily discounted prices .
Wines from the poorly regarded, but perfectly acceptable, 1981, 1982, and
1983 vintages are often sold at bargain basement prices in the wine auctions
for the same reason.</P>
