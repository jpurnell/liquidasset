   <p align="center"><b> ABSTRACT</b></p>
<p>Analyses are made of two wine tastings, one of red and one of white wines,
 to compare French and American styles.  It is concluded that there are differences
 between the wines and, in the case of the reds, national differences.  It is shown that
 even skilled tasters can often be out by as much as 3 when judging on a scale from 0
 to 20.  For the statistician, Bayes factors are contrasted with F-values.</p>

 <p align="center"><b>1. DATA</b></p>
<p>This note deals with the analysis of some data from one of the most famous
 wine-tastings, as reported in the Underground Wine Journal for July 1976. The
 tasting was organized by Englishman Steven Spurrier in Paris in order to introduce
 Californian wines to experienced, French wine-tasters. Some French wines were
 included to add to the interest.</p>
<p>There were 11 tasters, one of whom was Spurrier, and another was an
 American, Patricia Gallagher (these two were co-directors of L'Acad&eacute;mie du Vin in
 Paris).  The remaining 9 were French. Table 1 lists them, together with their
 numerical coding used in other tables and in this text.</p>
<p>There were two tastings.  One was of Chardonnays; the other of Cabernet
 Sauvignons, that is, of wines in which that grape was predominant.  In both tastings
 there were 10 wines in all, 6 American and 4 French.  The Chardonnays are listed in
 Table 2, the Cabernets in Table 3, in both cases with their numerical codes.  The
 American wines were all from the Napa valley.  The French Chardonnays were from
 Burgundy; the French Cabernets from Bordeaux; in both case wines of distinguished
 pedigrees.  Each taster tasted every wine once, giving it a score from 0 to 20
(though 19 and 20 were never used).  A few half-scores, like 14&frac12; occurred.
 The results are given in Table 4 for the white wines, and in Table 5 for the reds.
 Thus taster #4 gave Chardonnay <b>E</b> a score of 13.</p>
<p>This is virtually all the information available. We do not know in which
order the wines were tasted, so that any possible carry-over effects cannot be
investigated. It is not clear whether the tasters compared notes. There is no
evidence that they did except in the case of tasters 7 and 11 with the white wines,
where their results are identical except for a disagreement of &frac12; with wine <b>B</b>.
 They differ on the reds.  The tastings were all blind.  There is a suggestion that some, at
least, of the tasters gave their opinion as to the country of origin of a wine, but no
record is available. Of course, in giving a high score to a wine, an experienced
taster may be reflecting his preference for the familiar as against the strange.
</p>
<p>The results surprised the French and delighted the Californians.  Our task is
two-fold: to see how far these views are justified; and to explore the possibility of a
statistical analysis of a well-organized tasting using modern methods.</p>

<p align="center"><b>2. MEANS</b></p>
<p> Table 6 lists the mean scores over the 11 tasters for each of the 20 wines
under the heading 'raw means'. (The other values in the table will be discussed
later.)  Also listed are the means for each country and overall, both for red and
white wines.  Notice that, unlike those for the tasters, the codes for the
wines are in a purposeful order, namely from <b>A</b>, which has the highest mean, to
<b>J</b> for the lowest.</p>
<p> There are marked differences between the Chardonnay wines, which are
confirmed by a statistical analysis provided in  Section 5 below.  There are three that do well,
with mean scores around 14 (<b>A</b>,<b>B</b>,<b>C</b>), one of which is French.  One American does
badly (<b>J</b>). The remainder form a more homogeneous group with mean scores
between 10.0 and 11.8, though there is some evidence of differences here also.  The
French do slightly better than the Americans but the difference is unimportant and
could easily arise by chance. If the poorly-performing wine <b>J</b> is removed, the
American mean is higher than the French, but again the difference is unimportant.
Thc exclusion of wine <b>J</b> has been justified on account of its non-Gallic character,
and it is certainly true that the two non-French tasters (#4,8) gave it higher scores
than any Gallic taster.  Nevertheless, the same argument has been put forward for
wine <b>G</b> in the Cabernet tasting, whereas it did not disgrace itself.</p>
<p> The first conclusion is that the American Chardonnays did as well as the
French, but that there are real differences between some wines.  If the French were
expecting to give high marks to their own wines in comparison with those from
Napa, they failed.</p>
<p>There are similarly marked differences between the Cabernets, that again are
confirmed by a statistical analysis in Section 5. The wines do not naturally group
themselves, there being a steady trend from the top two (<b>A</b>,<b>B</b>) at a mean score of
14.1, to the bottom two (<b>I</b>, <b>J</b>) at around 9.7. Unlike the whites, the French reds
are really judged better than the Americans with a mean score that is higher by 2.0.
Four US wines do rather poorly and only two are up with the French.  Presumably
in the scoring by the French tasters, they would judge a wine of Gallic type more
highly than one of a different style, as the Americans were.  The latter were pure
Cabernets whilst the familiar French style is not.  This national difference is slightly
supported by the fact that the non-French tasters (#4,8) did tend to give high marks
to US wines. Thus taster #4 gave wine <b>G</b> a score of 17, against an average of
10.4; and wine <b>J</b> a score of 15, against an average of 9.6.</p>
<p> On this simple basis of the means, the tasters observed real differences
between the wines, both red and white.  With the whites, the Americans held their
own, but were not so successful with the reds.  The claim that the Americans won is
presumably based on the fact that both the top wines were from the Napa valley.
We will later see why this claim is probably fallacious.</p>
<p> We now turn to the tasters.  Their means over the 10 wines for both of the
tastings are listed in Table 7. In the case of the Cabernets, the differences are most
reasonably due to chance.  There are substantial differences with the Chardonnays,
but these largely, though not entirely, disappear if the rogue wine <b>J</b> is removed.
Whatever variation there is between the tasters is small in comparison with that
between the wines. In any case, in comparative tastings it does not matter if a
taster is biased. Another reason for not paying much attention to the apparent
difference is that they are not systematic from white wine to red, with the exception
of taster #5 who is low on both.</p>
<p align="center"><b>3. COMPARISON OF THE WINES</b></p>
<p>What a consumer wants to know is whether one wine is better than another.
This tricky problem is now addressed.  The means given for the wines are somewhat
misleading for a reason now to be explained. Suppose that there were truly no
differences between the 10 wines in each group.  Then, because tasting and scoring
are not precise sciences, the means over the 11 tasters will not all be equal, one
wine will be at the top, another will be at the bottom in the scale of means.  The
spread of the observed means is spurious, for the wines are truly the same.  To
incorporate this observation, the spread needs to be reduced.</p>
<p>The same consideration applies when there are (as in this tasting) real
differences between the wines.  The apparently best wine is truly not as good as it
looks: the apparently worst one is not all that bad. To correct for this, the means
need to be 'shrunk' towards the average over all the wines. Table 6 provides, in
addition to the observed means, these shrunk values.  Thus the top Cabernet at 14.1
comes down to 13.6. Chardonnay <b>I</b> rises from 10.0 to 10.5. (The eccentric <b>J</b>
has been removed for technical reasons.) The revised, shrunk means provide a
better reflection of the true worths of the wines than do the raw data.</p>
<p> With these corrected values, it is now possible to compare the wines in pairs.
 This is done in Table 10 for the whites, and in Table 11 for the reds.  Each entry in
 the table is the probability, expressed as a percentage, that the wine of that row is
 better than the wine of that column. Thus, referring to Table 11, the entry of 73
in the row numbered <b>B</b> and column numbered <b>D</b>, means that there is a probability of
 0.73, or 73%, that wine <b>B</b> is truly better than wine <b>D</b>.  Entries of 99% or more
 have been denoted by * and it is reasonable to claim in these cases that these 11
 tasters thought that the two wines were truly different.  Thus the first three Cabernets
 are all better than the last 4. Again wine <b>J</b> has been omitted from the
 Chardonnay table.  It can now be seen why the claim that, since a US wine was
 the best in each class, the Americans won, is doubtful. There is only a 52%
 probability that red wine <b>A</b> is better than <b>B</b>; and therefore a 48% probability that
 it is worse.  It is not until wine <b>A</b> is compared with wine <b>E</b>, another American,
 that there is substantial probability of a real difference. Similar remarks apply to
 the whites.</p>
<p align="center"> <b>4. RESIDUALS</b></p>
<p> We have seen that there are real differences between the wines, both red and
 white, and slight differences between the tasters with the white wines.  Consequently,
 if we take the score given by a taster to a wine, it will be affected by the wine and
 by any bias of the taster. It will also be affected by the fact, already mentioned,
 that tasting is not a precise science.  It is revealing to see how large this last effect
 is.  To illustrate, consider taster #4 with Cabernet <b>E</b>. She gave it a score of 16
 (Table 5).  The mean for all Cabernets is 11.84 (Table 6). <b>E</b> had a mean over all
 tasters of 12.14 (Table 6), an excess of 12.14 - 11.84 = 0.30. Taster #4 had a
 mean over all wines of 13.90 (Table 7), an excess of 2.06. So taking account of the
 wine and the taster involved, the score expected would be 11.84 + 0.30 + 2.06 =
 14.20. The observed value of 16 is in excess of this by 1.80 and is a measure of
the imprecisions of tasting and scoring. It is called a residual. Table 8 lists all the
residuals for the Chardonnays, and Table 9 does the same for the Cabernets. A
negative entry means that the score given was less than that expected on the basis
solely of the wine and the taster.</p>
<p>There is no systematic pattern to these residuals but there are a few large
values.  With the white wines, taster #3 gave an exceptionally low score of 3 to wine
<b>A</b>, giving rise to a residual of -7.36. He gave a high score to wine <b>C</b>, resulting in
a residual of +6.41. With the reds, there is a possibility that the tasters confused
wines <b>H</b> and <b>I</b>. The residuals are high in opposite directions for tasters #5 and #10,
and less so for tasters #1 and #2.</p>
<p>The real interest in these residuals lies in their general magnitude, rather than
in specific cases. To investigate this, we have, for each wine, taken the squares of
the residuals, so avoiding their signs, and calculated their means.  These are called
variances and the value for each wine is given in Table 6. The larger this quantity
is, the more variable were the tasters' judgements of that wine.  Thus amongst the
Chardonnays, wine <b>H</b> provoked the most disagreement, having a high variance of
15.06. In contrast there was near unanimity about wine <b>D</b> with 3.04. Similarly,
amongst the Cabernets, wine <b>I</b> was found hard to judge, with a variance of 15.87;
wine <b>F</b> was the easiest with 2.90. Similar variances for the tasters are given in
Table 7.    Here tasters #7 and #11 stand out for their consistency, having low
variances though it should be recalled that they most likely co-operated in assessing
the Chardonnays. No taster stands out as being especially variable in both
tastings.</p>
<p>A quantity of considerable interest is the mean of these variances.  It is 8.14
for the whites, and 8.26 for the reds. (Readers familiar with the analysis of
variance can appreciate this from Tables 12 and 13.) Remember these are means of
squares.  So if the square roots are taken, we shall obtain something in the same
units as the original scores.  The results are 2.85 and 2.87, virtually identical and
2.9 will be used.  The near identity demonstrates that the tasters found the two sets
of wines equally difficult to judge.  Recall that 2.9 measures the lack of precision in
scoring and is not affected by either the wine or the bias of the taster.  A technical
argument (based on the normal distribution) shows that about one third of the time
a taster will be out by at least 2.9, in either direction, when giving a score.  This
is borne out by the tables of residuals.  Thus when a wine is given a score of 12, it
could easily be 9 or 15, one third of the time even larger.  A residual of twice 2.9,
5.8, is unlikely to be exceeded.  Thus a score of 12 only asserts a true score of a
little more than 6, or a little less than 18. Tasting of red and white wines is
imprecise. This fact demonstrates the need for several, independent tasters. To
reduce that 2.9 to 1.0, so that the mean score is most likely not to be more than 1 out,
requires 9 tasters. To be fairly sure of a discrepancy of no more than 1,
requires about 33. The participants in this tasting were highly regarded, so this
result testifies to how hard skilled people find the judgement of wine.  Yet there are
often articles in the wine press that give opinions based on that of the author alone.
Unless the author is much more skilled than the participants in this tasting, the
opinions cannot be relied upon.</p>
<p align="center"><b>5. TECHNICAL ISSUES</b></p>
<p> Appreciation of this section requires some knowledge of statistics.
Statisticians will immediately recognize the two data sets as examples of two-way
tables of sizes l0 by 11. They will therefore expect analyses of variance.  These are
provided in Table 12 for the Chardonnays and Table 13 for the Cabernets.  There is
no replication, so the interaction between wines and tasters cannot be evaluated.
The tables of residuals (8 and 9) do not suggest any interactions; for example,
between the two French tasters and the French wines.  A study of the appropriate
one degree of freedom confirms this.  An additive model appears adequate and the
wine&times;tasters sums of squares have been used as errors.</p>
<p>The analysis-of-variance tables include the components of variance and their
usual estimates.  In the case of the white wines, the analyses without the anomalous
wine <b>J</b> been given. In the case of the Chardonnays with wine <b>J</b>
excluded, the variance between wines is 2.18 and that between tasters a little less at
1.77, both substantially less than the residual discussed in Section 4 of 8.26. For the
Cabernets, the variance between wines is a little higher at 2.56, whereas that
between tasters is much lower at 0.64. The residual at 8.67 is higher and virtually
the same as that for the Chardonnays.  It is these components of variance that have
been used to decide on the amount of shrinkage of the wine means.  This shrinkage
avoids all problems over multiple comparisons.</p>
<p> Standard practice with such tables is to perform significance tests; here F-
tests of wines, or tasters, against the residuals.  Recent work shows that such tests
are unreliable indicators of effects, usually on the side of suggesting effects that do
not exist. The coherent alternative is to calculate Bayes factors. They give the
factor by which the prior odds on the null hypothesis of no effect has to be
multiplied to give the posterior odds.  Both are given in the tables and it will readily
be seen that the Bayes factor is more conservative than the F-test. For example,
take the one degree of freedom for France versus the States in the Cabernet table
(#13).  The F-test is significant at 0.1%, or 0.001. The Bayes factor is only 0.020,
20 times greater.</p>
