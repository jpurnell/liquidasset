     ( 7 is the best possible,  28 is the worst)
<br>
<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1837
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2773. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.
<br>
 The correlation I measures the degree to which the identification of each 
 judge is correlated with the truth. Here a 1.0 means that the judge identified
 the wines perfectly, and a 0 means that he identified none of them.

  Mike                  0.6325         1.0000                                   
  Zachy                 0.6325         1.0000

  Dick                 -0.9487         1.0000                                   
                                                                                
                                                                                
<br>
<br>
 Next, we show the correlation among the wine identifications of the judges,
 which also ranges between 1.0 and 0.0:
<br>
     C = 0.7551
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large: > 10%. Most people would say that unless this probability
 is less than 0.1, the judges' identifications are not highly related.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is Heitz Martha&acute;s Vineyard 1987      
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine B is Heitz Bella Oaks 1985             
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine A is Heitz Bella Oaks 1984             
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine C is Heitz Bella Oaks 1987             

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  3.8571. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.2773

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  1.00 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This is a great and rare opportunity to taste a classic cabernet wine     
  from the eighties, which is a golden era, in magnum format. The wines did   
  not disappoint; they exhibited classic Bordeaux charateristics and       
  during our conversations they would not have been out of place with the   
  great &acute;82 and &acute;83 Bordeaux. The 87s were a bit of a different class from    
  the others. In general the bouquets of these wines are less complex        
  than European wines of similar vintage. In term of the style of the       
  wines, these wines exhibited similar levels of alcohol at 13.5% to        
  the Bordeaux wines of the same period and they appeared to drink as well. 
  For the group as a whole there was a clear preference for the &acute;87 vintage  
  and for the Martha&acute;s vineyard in particular.<br>                              
  The group felt that these were noticeably good cabernets. There was some   
  argument in the group whether they were clearly Californian or whether    
  they could be mistaken for Bordeaux.
