 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.6235
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0000. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine F is 1986

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 34.9167. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0000

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  It was an eye opening tasting of normale Barbaresco wines. It is worth    
  noting the continuing quality of the producer over 36 years. In terms of  
  the life left in the wines the group felt that the vintages of the 1980s 
  still had lively fruit and several  years of enjoyable drinking ahead     
  of them. All of these wines were the result of a single vineyard or       
  more being declassified and hence the total production being normale.     
  This leads us to speculate that in poorer vintages this particular       
  wine is a blend of these fine vineyards.                                  
                                                                            
  Very exceptionally, the group was unanimous in voting fort one wine, the  
  1979 vintage as it least preferred wine . A question was raised           
  concerning whether the wines from the 1980s will continue to drink well   
  in the future. It is possible that in 2014 we had reached the sweet spot  
  for drinking the better made vintages from the 1980s.
  
  As the statistics reveal, the degree of agreement in the group was exceptionally 
  high, caused at least in part by the unanimity concerning the 1979 vintage, which
  had a pronounced sherry flavor. It is somewhat surprising that our overall rankings 
  have a rank correlation of 0.872 with those of Parker, with whose rankings we tend,
  on the whole, to have lower correlations.
