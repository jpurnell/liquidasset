 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3860
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0005. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine G is Nuits Saint Georges Leroy         
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine F is Vosne Romanees Suchots Hudelot

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 27.7926. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0005
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is   0.2594. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.4830 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.70 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.60 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The first conclusion we can draw is that the 1991 Burgundies are really   
  good and very drinkable now. To the surprise of many, the Gevrey          
  Chambertin by Rousseau scored in the same range as wines that were much   
  more expensive. The price of the latter, which scored the same points     
  against as the DRC Romanee Saint Vivant, probably cost a tenth as much.   
   The disappointment of the evening was the unanimity about the Musigny    
  de Vogue.  The DRCs were also disappointing, particularly given their     
  price. Madam Leroy proved her excellence with her early versions after her
  separation from DRC and her Nuits Saint Georges Les Lavieres won this     
  tasting handily. The other producers who did very well were Dugat and     
  Hudellot-Noellat.
