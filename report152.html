 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.4245
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0007. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine G is Casanova di Neri                  
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   tied for  2nd place    Wine H is Il Poggione                       
  3.   tied for  2nd place    Wine I is Pieve Santa Restituta Rennina     
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine E is Castelgiocondo                    
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine D is Salicutti                         
  6.   tied for  6th place    Wine F is Poggio Antico                     
  7.   tied for  6th place    Wine C is Conti Constanti                   
  8.   ........  8th place    Wine B is Uccelliera

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 27.1667. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0007

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.70 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.60 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  One wine, the Il Poggione, was corked by agreement of several people and  
  was replaced with an identical uncorked bottle by our host. This is a     
  rare example where a flawed wine could be replaced. Our host, who         
  normally buys Bordeaux and Burgundies, explained that the wine world felt
  that Brunello has finally become grown up. He bought these wines with the
  regular cuvees and that we should drink them today, 10 years after the    
  vintage, so that we could in a future tasting compare them to the reserves 
  from the same producers. The wines were wonderful today and would be as   
  good or better in the next 3-5 years.It is very rare that the group is in 
  perfect agreement about any wine. The Nardi was ranked dead last by every 
  person present. This wine was disliked for various reasons that are hard  
  to summarize. But there was nearly as strong agreement on the excellence  
  of the Casanova di Neri. This wine was noticeably more complex than its   
  competitors.
