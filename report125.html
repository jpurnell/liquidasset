 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1629
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2438. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  9.1250. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.2438

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  All of these wines were without fault. The 1995 was the <em>Wine Spectator</em>
  "wine of the year" in 1998, with a score of 97. The three wines with the
  highest Parker scores were the 2000 (94), 1995 (94) and the 1982 (94). The
  current cost of the 2000 is about $275 and that of the 1982 is $465. 
  
  We had some very big surprises, including a lot of disappointment with the 1982 and 
  some surprises with the longevity of the 1970. The wines were clearly part of a 
  continuous family. It is interesting that the three highest Parker ratings were the 
  three lowest in this tasting. That says something about either Parker or  
  the group. In years past, this group has had horizontal tastings of 1970    
  Bordeaux, including several first growths. The Ducru Beaucaillou was      
  rated either first or second in those tastings.
