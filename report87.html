<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3746
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0469. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is Ch. Mouton Rothschild 1983       
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine A is Ch. Gruaud Larose 1983            
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine C is Ch. Margaux 1983                  
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine B is Ch. Palmer 1983                   
---------------------------------------------------
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine E is Ch. Latour 1983                   
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine F is Ch. Lafite Rothschild 1983        

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 11.2381. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0469

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  These wines gave us an incredible amount of pleasure (proof: everybody's  
  glass is empty.)                                                          
  Consistent with our other tastings, the Gruaud Larose showed itself       
  off as a worthy competitor with the first growths. However, anyone who    
  has a dinner party, and has these  wines in his cellar, should feel free  
  and pleased to share them now. Of the first growths, the value 
  for money wine is the Mouton. There is some reason to argue 
  that the Latour and the Lafite are not quite ready to drink yet. 
  One taster noted that the bouquet of the Gruaud Larose was outstanding.   
  On the whole, all these wines were extraordinarily enjoyable and all      
  of us who buy and keep Bordeaux wines hope to get this in the long run.
  <br>
  It is also noteworthy that the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between
  Parker's ratings for these wines and the group's ranking is -0.086, i.e., negative,
  although this coefficient is not statistically significant.
