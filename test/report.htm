 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0802
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.7432. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine H is 2004

  5.   tied for  4th place    Wine C is 2005

  8.   tied for  8th place    Wine A is Ch.Leoville Barton 1986

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  5.1333. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.7432

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.70 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.60 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This is ghe first time the group has ever taster Leoville Barton.         
  One of our member has composed a poem in honor of Leoville Barton.        
  Bedcause much of itds has been shipp[ed to the UK.                        
  There was a limey named Martin                                            
  Who did not have a toilet to fart in,                                     
  To poor to buy food                                                       
  He lived in the tube,                                                     
  And drank nothing but Leoville Barton.                                    
  L.B. has gained a reputtion over the 30 years for qwuality and reasonqable
  value. Over the 20 nyear span there has been great consistency in the qual
  ity of these wines. This tasting bears out this conclusion. The L.B. drink
  well for AT LEAsT 30 YEARS AND PERHAPS, longer.
