 We now measure the amount of correlation (W) among the judges: 
 W = 1.0 => perfect correlation, W = 0 => no correlation

 We also provide a probability measure that this correlation is due to chance

 In this case the Kendall W correlation is =     0.0824

 Probability that correlation is due to chance = 0.2000

 The Friedman Chi square is =       9.80
 and the probability that this is due to chance is the same 0.2000



We compute the correlation of each taster with the average ranking of the oth-
ers. 1.0 => perfect correlation, 0 => no correl., -1.0 => total disagreement

 The correlation between the aggregate ranking and the  wine prices is 0.0000.
This has to exceed 0.5240 to be statistically significant.
