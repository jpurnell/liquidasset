<div class=body>Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):<br><br>    W = 0.4171<br><br>The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation is quite small, 0.0514. Most analysts would say that since this probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences appear to be strongly related.<br><br>We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group preference.<br>A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a perfect predictor of the group's preferences.<br>A 0.0 means no correlation, while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group. This is measured by the correlation R.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering. The Friedman Chi-Square value is 12.514. The probability that this could happen by chance is  0.051.</div>
<div class=body>We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correlations that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.<br><br></div>
<div class=body>Pairwise Rank Correlations<br><br>Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.753 for significance at the 0.05 level, and must exceed  0.676 for significance at the 0.10 level.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>COMMENT:<br><br>Overall this was a repeat of a previous tasting in 2021. The wines were glorious. There was numerous agreement amongst the group and we have never had a joint winner. The longevity of these Chambertins was remarkable and a testament to the greatness of Chambertin. It is also a testimony to the joy of great mature Burgundy that is between 20-30 years of age.<br>The range of wines included most of the great vineyards of Chambertin over a series of top vintages. In terms of the top two wines while the 2002 is the most famous vintage the 2006 also produced great wines. Also worth comment is that  top two wines were both from negotiants, these are often seen as less prestigious as domaine wines but they can clearly hold their own with these wines. Giradin for the Latricieres and Potel for the Clos de Beze.<br>There was concern expressed about the affordability of these wines today and the limited production of these wines does not help, especially given the growing global demand. The estimated price of the winners today is $350-400 a bottle if they can be found.<br>One of the wines had a defective cork. It was the Mazis 1995 from Domaine Laurent. The underlying quality of the wine however still ensured it held up against the others. This wine in our previous tasting came 2nd.<br>The delicious cheeses complimented the wines to make it a truly memorable experience.	</div>
