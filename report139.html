 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0580
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.8610. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  3.2500. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.8610

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This was a most remarkable tasting in that all the wines were extra-     
  ordinary, which may explain the complete lack of correlation among them. 
  They all had superb bouquets, fantastic fruit and satisfactory levels of  
  acid. As one taster remarked, they were all flawless, and the rankings    
  which are forced (no ties are ever allowed) reflected this feature. It is 
  our feeling that these wines will last a long time, although in spite    
  of their relatively young age, they are all perfectly ready to drink.     
  In spite of these comments, we would expect all these wines to get better 
  and even more enjoyable with time. Even though the following result       
  is not statistically significant, it is interesting to note that the 2003s
  did not do better than any of the others, in fact did worse on the whole. 
  It is also clear that some of the tasters had definite differential preferences      
  among the vintages, but the results do not mean that there were no differences 
  among the vineyards or vintages. It was also abundantly clear that the least
  liked wine by each taster would nevertheless make him very happy.
