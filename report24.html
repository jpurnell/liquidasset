     ( 4 is the best possible,  28 is the worst)




 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):


     W = 0.3036




 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2952. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  7.2857. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.2952

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Fascinating opportunity to taste top-flight Hungarian sweet wines         
  of which none was oxidized and they showed varying degrees of sweetness.  
  It was generally agreed that the two ringers, the Monbazillac and the     
  Austrian Trockenbeerenauslese, were recognizably different. One taster    
  ranked them first and second, another sixth and seventh, showing that     
  there is a strong disagreement in preferences. The 1993 Essencia from     
  the Royal Tokai Wine Company represented the greatest consensus in the    
  tasting, and was widely agreed to be outstanding. It had wonderful        
  sugar/acid balance, and reminded all the tasters of the essence of apri-  
  cots. The weakest wine, 1973 5 puttonyos, was quite dark and seemed to    
  have lost some of its sweetness (drink up!). The Trockenbeerenauslese     
  was outstanding, but for some tasters, too young, but still very drink-   
  able today. Some thought it was perfect today. There are surprisingly few 
  tastings of sweet wines, and this tasting showed there should be more.    
  High quality sweet wines have a balance of acidity and sugar that cannot  
  be equaled by any other wine; sadly, sweet wines without an acid balance  
  have given the whole category a bad reputation.
