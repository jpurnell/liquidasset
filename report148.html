 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1830
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1748. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.
<br>
 The correlation I measures the degree to which the identification of each 
 judge is correlated with the truth. Here a 1.0 means that the judge identified
 the wines perfectly, and a 0 means that he identified none of them.

<br>
<br>
 Next, we show the correlation among the wine identifications of the judges,
 which also ranges between 1.0 and 0.0:
<br>
     C = 0.7500
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large: > 10%. Most people would say that unless this probability
 is less than 0.1, the judges' identifications are not highly related.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine A is 1990                              
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine D is 2002                              
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine B is 2003                              
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine C is 1995                              
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine F is 1952                   
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine H is 1996                              
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine E is 1959                              
---------------------------------------------------
  8.   ........  8th place    Wine G is 1966                              

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 10.2500. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1748

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The wines were in excellent condition, including the wine that was almost 60 
  years old; there were subtle differences among them in acidity,the amount of tannin 
  and fruit.Forced preference, which we use, by its nature highlights very small
  differences in terms of preference. In the case of these wines, which were very close to
  one another, this feature emphasizes the cost of rank ordering the wines rather than
  grading them. This subject is discussed in a recent and brilliant book by Michel Balinski 
  and Rida Laraki, <em>Majority Judgment: Measuring, Ranking, and Electing</em>, MIT Press, 2011.

  An interesting question is whether the younger wines (1990 and later) are significantly different 
  from the older ones (1966 and earlier). The Quandt statistic for testing the significance of the ratios
  of two ranksums (when divided by the number of ranksums in the numerator and denominator) is 1.3713 
  when the sum of the ranksums for the older wines is divided by the sum of the ranksums for
  the younger ones. The upper tail critical value is 1.2422; hence we can say with some confidence that
  the younger wines were deemed to taste better. It is worth mentioning in this connection that the three
  oldest wines, while in good bottle condition, did have considerable sediment and were decanted before the 
  tasting. This might have something to do with their lower appeal. But overall, the quality of these wines
  underscores the lasting power of wines from this vineyard over 60+ years.
  
  All in all, this was an exceptional tasting.
