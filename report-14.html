     ( 5 is the best possible,  35 is the worst)

 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2371
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.3104. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   tied for  1st place    Wine B is Barbaresco Sori San Lorenzo 1978  
  2.   tied for  1st place    Wine C is Barolo Sperss 1988                
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine E is Barbaresco Sori Tilden 1978       
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine A is Barbaresco Sori San Lorenzo 1990  
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine F is Barolo Sperss 1989                
---------------------------------------------------
  6.   tied for  6th place    Wine D is Barbaresco Sori Tilden 1990       
  7.   tied for  6th place    Wine G is Barbaresco Sori San Lorenzo 1989  

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  7.1143. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.3104

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  While the agreement in the group was not strong, it seems fairly clear that the 1978 ans 1988 were 
  preferred to the 1989 and 1990.
