 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3446
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0340. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is Geyserville Zinfandel 1990        
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   tied for  2nd place    Wine E is Lytton Springs Zinfandel 1991     
  3.   tied for  2nd place    Wine F is Geyserville Zinfandel 1992        
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine A is Geyserville Zinfandel 1985        
---------------------------------------------------
  5.   tied for  5th place    Wine B is Lytton Springs Zinfandel 1986     
  6.   tied for  5th place    Wine C is York Creek Cab. Sauv. 1987        

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 12.0612. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0340

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This was a rare opportunity to taste aged single cellar Ridge wines     
  which were predominantly Zinfandel. Overall, they surprised the tasters 
  in their consistency and in the fact that they have held up so well       
  given the assumptions expecially about Zinfandel. It was remarkable    
  how consistently the tasters percceived these wines as two-tiered and      
  how strong the preference was for the wines of the early 1990s as      
  distinct from the wines of the mid-1980s. One taster noted that his first
  choices were all Geyservilles. 
  
  A question was raised about the alcohol levels in these wines. It turns out 
  that none exceeded 14% and most were close to what a wine maker who picked 
  grapes at 23 brix would obtain (ie, 13.8%). The exception was the 86 Ridge 
  Montebello cabernet sauvignon, served after the others, which had alcohol 
  of 11.8%--and was considered the finest wine on the table by some of those present.
