 We now measure the amount of correlation (W) among the judges:
 W = 1.0 => perfect correlation, W = 0 => no correlation

 We also provide a probability measure that this correlation is due to chance

 In this case the correlation is =     0.2134

 Probability that correlation is due to chance = 0.0269



We compute the correlation of each taster with the average ranking of the oth-
ers and with prices. 1.0 => perfect, 0 => none, -1.0 => total disagreement
