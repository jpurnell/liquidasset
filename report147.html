 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2359
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0672. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   tied for  1st place    Wine F is Groot Constantia Gouverneur's Reserve 1998 Constantia

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 13.2083. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0672

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  One of the tasters felt that the wines lacked significant bouquets,       
  while another felt that a distinct hint of eucalyptus was present in  
  a number of the wines. Everyone thought that the wines, with one       
  exception, had developed nicely and were delicious to drink now. The       
  Kanonkop was considered flawed by many of the tasters.                   
  The flawed Kanonkop may not be representative of other bottles of this    
  wine. Our host felt that, having tasted the wines individually        
  previously, taken as a group the wines seemed sweeter and less acidic.    
  With the exception of the flawed wine there was remarkable agreement      
  among the tasters about the quality of the remaining seven wines          
  which were extraordinarily delicious to drink. (Note that the p-value of
  the W copefficient was 0.067, i.e., almost significant at the 0.05 level.)
  
  No significant vintage effects were seen. We can test the sum of ranksums
  for each year against the sum over the remaining two years (ignoring the
  complication that three such tests are not independent of one another) and none
  of these tests has a significant result, not even testing the year 2000 against 
  the other two, which superficially seems to promise most in terms of significance.
