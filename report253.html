<div class=body>Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):<br><br>    W = 0.1324<br><br>The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation is rather large, 0.3868. Most analysts would say that unless this probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly related.<br><br>We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group preference.<br>A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a perfect predictor of the group's preferences.<br>A 0.0 means no correlation, while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group. This is measured by the correlation R.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering. The Friedman Chi-Square value is  7.417. The probability that this could happen by chance is  0.387.</div>
<div class=body>We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correlations that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.<br><br></div>
<div class=body>Pairwise Rank Correlations<br><br>Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.705 for significance at the 0.05 level, and must exceed  0.626 for significance at the 0.10 level.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>COMMENT:<br><br>Overall these wines were marvelous with the wines being very similar and all very good.<br>There was not a single wine that disappointed and they were all youthful with many years ahead of them.<br>The wines were poured 90 minutes before the tasting began to help them loosen up.<br>In comparing them with equivalent burgundies, the feeling was that at 6 years these wines were more evolved and approachable. <br>Although there was no significant difference between the wines, the top wine from Steve Kistler, the Occidental cuvée Catherine (13.3%) is a wine which has done well in previous tastings. Interestingly the top 2 wines were the furthest apart geographically, with the Occidental coming from Bodega Bay in the south and the Littorai (12.8%) coming from the Northern Anderson valley, even though the distance is less than 100 miles.<br>In all cases these wines are made in cool climate vineyard with the range of alcohol levels being between 12.6% to 13.6% which in these days of climate change is appreciably on the low side.<br>These wines are all from single vineyard and quantities are around 400 cases at the most, requiring purchase directly from the winery to secure them. </div>
