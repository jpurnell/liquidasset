 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2046
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1198. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 11.4583. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1198

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  It has to be noted that the California wine was recognized by everybody    
  as a ringer and some people loved it while others hated it (relatively    
  speaking). Six of the wines come from individual                          
  vineyards of the same producer, and were  noticeably similarly ranked. 
  The overall correlation just misses being significant, and as in <a href="report130.html">Report 130</a>,
  overall the one American wine was the best liked.   
  Most of the wines were drinking very well indeed after 10 years in the    
  cellar and with underlying acidity were good food friendly wines. One      
  person present who drinks Kistler's pinot noirs often, commented that     
  the Papaietro has a similar character.  One of the group who recalls      
  the 2002 tasting of several years ago with clarity thought these wines    
  were fully comparable today.
