 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1012
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.5792. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine A is Torre Muga 2005                   
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine B is Bodegas Alion (Vega Sicilia) 2003 
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine D is Remirez de Ganuza Reserva 2005     
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine E is Hacienda Monasterio 2007        
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine F is Vega Sicilia "Unico" 2002         
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine C is Contino Vina del Olivo 2007       
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine G is Prado Enea Gran Reserva 2004

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  5.6667. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.5792
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is  -0.1566. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.5240 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  These were fantastic wines, that were very difficult to distinguish,      
  and all had distinctive tempranillo character. Our host gave us a very  
  difficult challenge, which we relish. The prices of the wines were
  enormously different, ranging from $15/bottle to $250/bottle, but the 
  quality of the winemakers was uniformly very     
  high. Only one distinguished member of this group correctly identified the 
  Vega Sicilia Unico. These were all very well made wines, but produced in        
  somewhat different styles. So it is understandable that some members of the
  group preferred wines quite different from the wines preferred by others.  In fact,
  the overall agreement among the members was low, as can be seen from the fact that
  some wines were ranked first as well as last by some members of the group.
  In the aggregate, the lowest price wine was rated lowest, but four members of the
  group had negative correlations with the prices of the wines.  These are relatively 
  young wines but they are all drinking very well. While the number 1 wine was a Rioja,    
  on average the Riberas ranked slightly higher than the Riojas. However, the statistical 
  significance test on the rank sums of the 5 Riojas versus the 3 Ribera del Dueros yields
  a test statistic of 0.914, not significantly different from 1.0. (See <em>Journal of Wine 
  Economics</em>, Vol. 2, No.1, 2007.)
