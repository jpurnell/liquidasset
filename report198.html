 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1101
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.5204. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine C is Ponzi 2010                        
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine B is Kistler Catherine 2009

  4.   ........  4th place    Wine G is Peter Michael Ma Danseuse 2010    
  5.   tied for  5th place    Wine H is Drouhin Dundee Hills 2014         
  6.   tied for  5th place    Wine A is Gary Farrell 2014                 
  7.   tied for  7th place    Wine F is Roserock Drouhin 2014

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  6.1667. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.5204
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is   0.3012. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.5240 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The wines were all very delicious and were very difficult to separate     
  which largely depended on individual preference. The wide range of        
  vintage dates and geography proved challenging. The older vintages did    
  well except for ome wine and the first place went to the Ponzi.      
  The most expensive wine in the group, Peter Michael, scored fourth. The
  only Grand Cru from Burgundy tied for last place.
