 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.6093
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0003. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine B is Cotarella's Montiano 2000         
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine D is Cotarella's Montiano 1995         
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine F is Cotarella's Montiano 1996

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 25.5918. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0003

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  When we began this tasting, our first reaction was that there was not much
  difference among these wines. But as time went on, we decided that there  
  were noticeable differences and we ended up with a very sharp discrimina- 
  tion among them. This is interesting because the Parker ratings of these  
  wines are highly clustered (93-96) but we had to differentiate among      
  them which the Parker ratings do not have to do. The tasting may have been
  influenced by what was possibly a bad bottle, namely the 1997, which had 
  the highest Parker rating but was very murky and exceptionally acidic. It 
  should also be noted that all these wines are ready to drink now. It is   
  also the case that we have had no wine tasting, as far as we remember, in 
  which the degree of agreement was this high. This is particularly         
  significant in that as a vertical tasting style differences are           
  insignificant.  
  
  Because there was such agreement that wine A, the 1997, might have been a bad bottle,
  on which everybody agreed, we decided to redo the calculations as if wine A had been absent. 
  The agreement among the jdges under this scenario continued to be high. The Kendall W 
  coefficient of concordance declines  to 0.4169, but this figure is still significant 
  at the 0.0123 level, which indicates an extremely strong level of agreement. Wine B, 
  the 2000, is rated as significantly good, and now, since wine A is absent, wine C, 
  the 1999, is rated significantly bad. On the whole, the agreement of the judges is 
  strong and cannot be attributed to the presence of the potentially bad bottle of the 1997.
