     ( 6 is the best possible,  42 is the worst)

 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3790
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0339. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine B is G Mascarello Barolo Monprivato 1997

  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine G is G Mascarello Barolo Monprivato 1999

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 13.6429. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0339

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  These are wines made of the Nebbiolo grape, produced nowhere else in the  
  world at this quality level. The wines have high natural acidity, uniformly 
  high quality and, served with our loin of pork and fagioli salad,  were      
  delicious. If you eliminate C, you get a somewhat different picture of   
  this tasting in that there is an enormously tight cluster of the          
  other six wines. The overall W coefficient drops to 0.1619, which is not
  significant (the probability of a W as large or larger is 0.4336).  One 
  reason for this result is that wine C was considered by several tasters 
  to be slightly oxidized. As a result, it certainly not surprising 
  that it was ranked last by the group. The group wondered if we were to     
  remove wine C whether or not we would have seen the correlation between   
  the tasters that came through in this tasting, and the result is that it
  became much weaker. However, the overall group ranking did not change, except 
  for the fact that wines F and G are now tied for second place.
