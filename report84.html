 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.4354
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0033. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 21.3333. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0033

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The wines drink as if they were more mature than their chronological age. 
  One wine, the Bertram's Cabernet, was oxidized. The Hartenberg and the    
  Allesverloren did not have much fruit. Le Bonheur, which was within one   
  point of being top wine, was exactly the same as the winner of the 1999   
  tasting of South African wines. The tasting also shows that Thelema is    
  a real powerhouse in South African wines. This tasting is very compatible 
  with the 1999 tasting in that at the earlier tasting the top three winners 
  were identical to the top three winners in today's tasting (although the  
  relative rankings of the top three were not the same), which suggests a 
  significant degree of intertemporal consistency in the group. Many of us in the  
  tasting were prepared to buy substantial quantities of Le Bonheur.       
  Reflecting on our <a href="report14.html">report from 1999</a>, which said   
  that the wines are drinking noticeably well in spite of their youth,     
  we can say that six years later they have matured well and are          
  drinking nicely.
  
  Added on January 15, 2012: Comparing Report 14 with the present one, we note that
  five of the wines in the trwo tastings were identical. The rank correlation between 
  the group rankings accorded to these five wines is 0.8. which is quite high and 
  suggests a considerable amount of intertemporal consistency; a feature which we have failed
  to observe in numerous other tastings with replicated wines.
