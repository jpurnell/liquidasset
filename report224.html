     ( 5 is the best possible,  35 is the worst)

 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0714
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.9061. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine C is Archaval Ferrer 2005              
  2.   tied for  2nd place    Wine A is Archaval Ferrer 2013              
  3.   tied for  2nd place    Wine G is Archaval Ferrer 2011              
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine B is Archaval Ferrer 2000              
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine E is Archaval Ferrer 2007              
  6.   tied for  6th place    Wine F is Archaval Ferrer 2009              
  7.   tied for  6th place    Wine D is Archaval Ferrer 2004              

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  2.1429. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.9061

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The wine group has not had a tasting since March 2, 2020 because of the   
  Covid-19 pandemic. Recently, one3 of our ingenious members figured out how
  we could continue out tasting while maintaining social distance. One mem- 
  ber (the "host") would decant each of the bottles to be tasted into the   
  requisite number of 100 mL bottles and then physically deliver all these  
  bottles to the other members' doorstep. At the appointed time a zoom      
  session would be initiated among the group members.                       
  The present tasting is a vertical tasting of Archaval Ferrarfrom Mendoza, 
  Argentina. The wines were all of high quality and eminently drinkable,    
  with some  variation in the degree of spiciness. But on the whole, they   
  were very similar, with no wone standing out as significantly good or bad.
  we were overjoyed to see out colleagues on zoom and to be, so to speak,   
  back in the groove.
