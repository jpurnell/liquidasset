 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.4375
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1738. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine A is Bonnes-Mares 1985, Mugnier        
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine C is Gevrey Chambertin 1985, St.Jacques
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine B is Clos St. Denis 1985, Castagnier   

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  3.5000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1738

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  1.00 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Every wine was absolutely superb. There was no stinker in this group of   
  1985 Burgundies. These seemed like really authentic examples of the       
  vineyards they were expected to represent. As the only former Wines       
  Officer of the Fourth Royal Horse Artillery present, and as the only one  
  present never to have participated in a wine tasting, Highgate feels      
  that his views should be accorded a weight less than one; however, he     
  can record with probability 1.0 that wines like these were never served   
  in the Fourth Royal Artillery. The reason why Gina likes the Gevrey-      
  Chambertin is becuse it is really ready to drink. The reason why Dick     
  liked the Bonnes-Mares best is because it is the spiciest of the wines.
