 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2619
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0405. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 14.6667. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0405

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Rare vertical tasting of eight vintage of Sassicaia, covering 37 years    
  including the 1985---considere4d by some critics as one of the greatest   
  wines made in Italy. The difficulty of the tasters to discern differences,
  with one exception, between these outstanding wines bore witness to the   
  truth that verticals are the truest and most challenging ooof all tastings
  Wigth the exceptio n of the 1978, all the wines were ddelicious with      
  several decades still in front of them...inclduing the 1985 which held its
  own well with its more4 useful siblings. Several tasters noted that the   
  nose on these wines was quite restrained. Some tasters noted that the     
  differences were surprisingly small, given the range in ages. Even the one
  that was unanimously last might have been affected by the difficulty of   
  opening it. This wine was judged significantly not liked and wine G       
  had interestingly a  bimodal distribution of ranks
