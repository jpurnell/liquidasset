 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2395
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0277. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine E is Heitz Martha's Vineyard 1997      
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine G is Ch. Grand Puy Lacoste 1997        
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine A is Ch. Talbot 1997                   
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine I is Ch. Gruaud Larose 1997            
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine H is Jarvis Reserve 1997               
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine D is Ch. Lynch Bages 1997              
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine C is Ch. Lagrange 1997

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 17.2444. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0277
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is   0.1167. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.4830 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.70 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.60 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Sadly, one wine in this tasting was corked. The people who ranked it ninth all     
  thought it was corked. It was the Mondavi Reserve 1997 which cost $139 per bottle.   
  This is not a judgment on Mondavi Reserve 1997, but a reflection on this particular   
  bottle. One taster does not think the qualitative determination of one wine                      
  being corked is dispositive. The ranking should be the ultimate judge. With 22   
  points against for the Heitz wine, this is the equivalent to being ranked second
  place by every one on average, an incredibly high agreement for this group. Some   
  members said that this underlines what a great vintage 1997 was in California.
    
  A new significance test has become available for testing the sum of ranksums for
  one subset of wines against the sum of ranksums for the complementary subset of wines.
  The test is based on the ratio R defined as (R<sub>1</sub>/n<sub>1</sub>)/(R<sub>2</sub>/n<sub>2</sub>), where R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> are the
  rank sums in the two subgroups and n<sub>1</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> are the respective number of items in 
  the groups. Letting the subscript 1 refer to the California wines, the ratio R is not 
  significantly small. However, if we remove wine B from the ranking (because it was corked)  
  and rerank the remaining wines, the ratio becomes 0.7548, which is significantly small at the 
  0.05 level, since the critical value for 9 judges and 8 wineswith 3 in one group and                                                         
  5 in the other is 0.7934. Hence, on the full sample we cannot say which subgroup was liked better,
  but with the indicated adjustment, the California wines were preferred as a group.
