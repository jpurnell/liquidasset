                                     FLIGHT 1:
                              Number of Judges =  4
                              Number of Wines  =  4
<br>
  Identification of the Wine:                   The judges' overall ranking:
<br>
  Wine A is Ch. Margaux 1959                              ........  4th place
  Wine B is Ch. Margaux 1966                              ........  1st place
  Wine C is Ch. Haut Brion 1959                           ........  2nd place
  Wine D is Ch. Latour 1959                               ........  3rd place
<br>
                        The Judges's Rankings
<br>
  Judge       Wine ->   A   B   C   D

  Orley                 3.  1.  2.  4.
  John                  4.  1.  2.  3.
  Burt                  4.  1.  2.  3.
  Grant                 4.  1.  2.  3.
<br>
                        Table of Votes Against

              Wine ->   A   B   C   D
<br>
     Group Ranking ->   4   1   2   3
     Votes Against ->  15   4   8  13
<br>
     ( 4 is the best possible,  16 is the worst)
<br>
<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.9250
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0112. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.
<br>
       Correlation Between the Ranks of
 Each Person With the Average Ranking of Others
<br>
  Name of Person      Correlation R

  Burt                  1.0000
  John                  1.0000
  Grant                 1.0000
  Orley                 0.8000


<br>
<br>
The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine B is Ch. Margaux 1966
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine C is Ch. Haut Brion 1959
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine D is Ch. Latour 1959
---------------------------------------------------
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine A is Ch. Margaux 1959

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 11.1000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0112

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

                           Pairwise Rank Correlations

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05
level and must exceed  1.00 for significance at the 0.1 level

COMMENTS:<br><br>


This event met with some serious weather problems!  It turned out that we were convening during the middle of a major snow storm.  Three people were unable to get over the roads, leaving us with only 4 tasters.  The storm also reduced the number of wines,
 as two of them did  not show up either.

Of the wines the 1959 Margaux and the 1959 Latour were oxidized.  There was unanimity that in this tasting the 1966 Margaux, which was still firm and in good condition, was a better wine than the 1959 Haut Brion.  All the wines came from the same cellar.
 This suggests that the 1959s may finally be coming toward the end of their best drinking period.  In the past the 59 Haut Brion has been a magnificent wine, but here it was much lighter than most of us remember it being in the past.  Perhaps it is time t
o drink up-and stop tempting fate.
