 We now measure the amount of correlation (W) among the judges:                 
 W = 1.0 => perfect correlation, W = 0 => no correlation                        
<br>
 We also provide a probability measure that this correlation is due to chance   
<br>
 In this case the correlation is =     0.1105                                   
<br>
 Probability that correlation is due to chance = 0.5055                         
<br>
  We compute the correlation of each taster with the average ranking of the oth-
 ers. 1.0 => perfect correlation, 0 => no correl., -1.0 => total disagreement

The 2000 vintage in Piedmont was initially proclaimed as the vintage of the century. The
feeling was that these wines were approachable and enjoyable. The wines we      
tasted today were a representative selection of the single-vineyard wines        
hand carried from Italy by our host. These are uniformly high quality wines.    
In general, they wines were fully mature. That may account for the              
lack of differences among them. Rarely, if ever, were the rank totals for       
the wines so similar. The overall difference in preferences varied by personal  
taste. They were all delicious. Overall, if you have these wines in you         
cellar, drink them.
