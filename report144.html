 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2443
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0479. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine B is 1990

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 15.6333. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0479

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.70 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.60 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  All the wines reflected richness and complexity. It is also noteworthy
  that there was statistically significant agreement between the rankings 
  of the tasters. An important question is this: 
  if we had not known that there was a 46 year gap between these wines,     
  would we have detected it? The answer is probably not. These wines are    
  Merlot based and our present experience contradicts the conventional      
  wisdom that Merlots are not long lived. Note that the youngest wine in    
  this group is 12 years old. The one vintage present here that by all standards        
  is widely considered inferior is the 1993. It was a    
  jolly good drink. The '94 and '95 are considered mid-level in quality.    
  They were jolly good drinks too. Parker rates the 1966 74 points, and     
  describes it browning badly, but we did not find that at all;             
  consequently we presume that Parker's ranking was based on a bad          
  bottle. However, we ranked the 1966 as the second lowest wine in the      
  group. In terms of the physical disposition of and trade dress of the     
  wines, it is noticeable that the weight and opacity of the oldest bottle  
  (1952) represented an earlier era versus the more modern bottle.
