 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2984
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0194. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 16.7083. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0194

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  These were unbelievably wonderful wines, which we tasted three years ago
  almost to the day. They have the classic aroma and flavor of Syrah from  
  Northern Rhone. Some felt that they could detect the Viognier grapes     
  and they gave a certain elegance and refinement to the wines (in the 2001      
  La Turque and La Mouline.) One person felt that there was a hint          
  Percaptans in wine H which he ranked 8. 
  
  This tasting provides a good opportunity to test our intertemporal consistency. 
  Six of the tasters in today's tasting were the same as three years ago, so for 
  each of those tasters we can compare their rankings today with those three years
  ago. The easiest way to do this is to compute for each taster the Spearman rho
  rank correlation coefficient, and here they are:
  
  Ed    0.1667
  Burt  0.2740
  Bob   0.1072
  Mike  0.3095
  Zaki  0.3453
  Dick -0.1070
  
  None of the tasters achieved what one might call a fantastic correlation with
  the results three years ago, although three scored creditably. One taster managed 
  to achieve a mild negative correlation with the earlier results. We did not compute
  the correlation between the two aggregate rankings because they are &quot;contaminated&quot; by
  the presence of two tasters who did not attend the later tasting. It is also noteworthy 
  that the Kendall W coefficient of concordance was 0.058 in the earlier tasting, which had a
  0.8610 chance of occurring by chance alone, whereas in the present tasting the Kendall W is 
  0.2984, which is highly significant. One final calculation we performed was the following. We 
  dropped the two people in the calculations who did not become repeat tasters in the second tasting 
  and the two were not present in the first tasting, and recalculated the results with only the six people 
  who were in both and then calculated the Spearman reho rank correlation between the <em>aggregate rankings</em>.
  The results are as follows:
  
  		                    First Tasting    Second Tasting
		Kendall's W            0.1640           0.3823
		Probability            0.4405           0.0246
		Rank correlation                0.3343
		
  The upshot of all this is the the degree of concordance among the remaining six tasters is greater when the
  two &quot;non-repeaters&quot; are omitted, buit the reank correlation between the two aggregate rankings is not 
  significant at any reasonable level of significance.
