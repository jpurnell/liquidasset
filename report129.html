 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3079
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0999. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different. The "Parker points" for each wine are given in parentheses
at the end of each line.

  1.   tied for  1st place    Wine B is Ch. Haut Brion 1997        (89)             
  2.   tied for  1st place    Wine E is Ch. Margaux 1997           (90)       
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine D is Ch. Margaux 1996           (99)

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  9.2381. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0999

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:
  All the wines were truly delicious. All were in perfect condition. These  
  wines have passed their tenth anniversary and are absolutely drinkable    
  now, with ripe fruit and good acidity. 
   
  Our host wisely provided a comparison of two vintages and three chateaux of 
  first growth Bordeaux chateau wines. Margaux was the top wine in the     
  tasting. Haut Brion was second and Lafite third. The 1997s slightly       
  edged out the 1996s. The 1997 Margaux and Haut Brion were tied.         
                                                                                
  On a price adjusted basis, 1997 is clearly the more attractive         
  vintage to buy. 
  
  It is interesting to note that the rank correlation (adjusted for ties) between
  the group's ranking of the wines and the Parker rankings is -0.382; hence a not
  inconsequential disagreement exists between the group and the Parker ratings.
