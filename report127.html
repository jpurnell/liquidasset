 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0400
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.5488. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

<br>
<br>
The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine A is Chave Hermitage Blanc 1985        
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine C is Dauvissat Chablis "Les Clos" 1990 
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine B is Louis Latour Chevalier Montrachet 1989

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  1.2000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.5488

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  1.00 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  In two of the flights (Flights 2 and 3) a small number of tasters entered tied ranks        
  which WINETASTER does not permit (because we made an early decision that  
  tied ranks encourage "lazy" tasting). In Flight 2, one taster had two wines tied and
  in Flight 3 three tasters had two wines tied each. We therefore broke the ties by      
  assigning the lexicographically earlier wine the lower and the            
  lexicographically later wine the higher of the tied ranks. To test the    
  impact of this, we also reranked the wines using the opposite convention.

 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.8400
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0000. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine A is Beaucastel CDP  1989              
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine B is Drouhin Latricieres Chambertin 1989
---------------------------------------------------
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine C is Drouhin Volnay-Santenots 1989     

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 25.2000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0000

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  1.00 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  As we indicated before, there was one pair of wines that were ranked a tie by one
  of the judges and we broke the tie by assigning the lexicographically earlier wine 
  the lower and the lexicographically later wine the higher of the tied ranks. To test
  the robustness of this procedure, we also computer the result for the reverse way of
  ranking the tied wines. The Kendall W coefficient then becomes 0.8044, the probability
  that this could have occurred by chance is 0.0000, as before, and wine A is still 
  significantly of high quality and C of low quality. We conclude that the tied rank and 
  our way of breaking the tie had no impact on the results.

 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.5164
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0000. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine A is Ridge Geyserville 1974            
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine D is Ridge Montebello 1991             
---------------------------------------------------
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine C is Ridge Montebello 1984             
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine B is Ridge Montebello 1981 (cabernet)  

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 23.2400. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0000

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  1.00 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Here we repated the procedure employed in Flight 2, i.e., we recalculated the results by breaking the 
  tied votes in the reverse way. The Kendal W now becomes 0.5342 (vs. the old value of 0.5164); the 
  probability that this could have occurred by chance is still 0.0000, wine A is still significantly 
  of high quality and wines C and D of low quality. Hence again the fact that ties were recorded originally 
  had no impact on the results.

 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.7920
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0000. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine A is Ridge Montebello 1969             
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   tied for  2nd place    Wine B is Ridge Eisele 1971                 
  3.   tied for  2nd place    Wine C is Ridge Petite Sirah York Creek 1971
---------------------------------------------------
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine D is Ridge "Vin Mystere" date unknown  

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 35.6400. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0000

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
