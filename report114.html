 We now measure the amount of correlation (W) among the judges:                 
 W = 1.0 => perfect correlation, W = 0 => no correlation                        
<br>
 We also provide a probability measure that this correlation is due to chance   

 In this case the correlation is =     0.5743                                   

 Probability that correlation is due to chance = 0.0002                         
<br>
We compute the correlation of each taster with the average ranking of the oth-  
ers and with prices. 1.0 => perfect, 0 => none, -1.0 => total disagreement

Comments:
Most people deemed the Muller-Catoir wine very austere. Andrew thought this is an 
Austran wine (wrong). 
The Petaluma Riesling was hideous. We all mentioned petrol (the bad one), gasoline,
diesel. This wine was almost undrinkable. 
Karl and Andrew thought that the wine by Hargegg had some of the traits of the 
Petaluma. A hint of gasoline and petrol.  
Most people liked the wine by Knebel. It was characterized as lightly sweet. 
Susan liked it even better after some time of breating. This is clearkly wine that
gains with time.
The wine by von Buhl was not liked very much. Most of us thought it was fizzy and
astringent.
Clemens Busch' Fahrlay Riesling Spatlese was the wine that had the most to offer. Dark yellow and an 
incredible richness in flavor and smell. The Kuenstler wine was the most expensive wine of the tasting 
($44). However, it was not liked very much. We described it as hollow and empty. 
The last wine (H) was another Clemens Busch wine, 'Vom Roten Schiefer'. It had a 'delicious 
sweetness with a dry finish'. 
<br>
Overall, this was a great tasting of dry and semi-dry Rieslings from Mosel, Rheingau, and Pfalz in Germany.
There was also an Austrian and, as a ringer, an Australian wine. 
<br>
Most of us agree that the top three wines were outstanding and way ahead of the pack. 
Surprisingly, these three wines were all from the Mosel
