<div class=body>Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):<br><br>    W = 0.2692<br><br>The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation is quite small, 0.0676. Most analysts would say that since this probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences appear to be strongly related.<br><br>We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group preference.<br>A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a perfect predictor of the group's preferences.<br>A 0.0 means no correlation, while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group. This is measured by the correlation R.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering. The Friedman Chi-Square value is 13.190. The probability that this could happen by chance is  0.068.</div>
<div class=body>We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correlations that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.<br><br></div>
<div class=body>Pairwise Rank Correlations<br><br>Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.705 for significance at the 0.05 level, and must exceed  0.626 for significance at the 0.10 level.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>COMMENT:<br><br>The Domaine Guigal located in the ancient village of Ampuis is an icon of the Rhone Valley vineyard. It produces, among other things, three emblematic vintages in the Côte Rôtie appellation, called the La-La-La trilogy, a contraction of La Mouline, La Turque, La Landonne. They are among the most sought-after wines in the region.<br><br>La Mouline is made from vines almost 75 years old, using traditional Côte Rôtie grape varieties: 89% Syrah and 11% Viognier. La Turque comes from younger vines, around 25 years old, composed of 93% Syrah and 7% Viognier. La Landonne is the only single-varietal cuvée, 100% Syrah aged around 35 years<br><br>This tasting was marvelous and somewhat uniquely it was a repeat of a tasting that was done 5 years earlier under Covid. <br>What is interesting is the evolution between the identical tasting conducted 5 years ago and this. At that tasting the wines were hard to separate with the 3 100 point 2005 wines being at the bottom of ranking, possibly due to being too young?<br><br>There was an unusual amount of agreement in terms of the preferred wines with the Kendall W being 0.2692 confirming the significance of the result. <br>The wine that was the winner was the La Landonne 2001. The 2005’s all improved their performance from an average rank of 6.3 to 3.3. Perhaps more interestingly La Turque was the overall preferred cuvée with the 2000 doing well in both tastings.<br><br>All the wines were exceptional, except for the 2001 La Mouline that was felt to be corked. These are not inexpensive wines but they truly are delicious and any an opportunity to enjoy them should not be missed. </div>
