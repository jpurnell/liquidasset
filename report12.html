     ( 8 is the best possible,  96 is the worst)

<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3269
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0025. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is Busch, Puendericher Marienburg Aus
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine F is Busch, Puendericher Marienburg Spt

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 28.7692. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0025
 
   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in
 the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
 
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations
 
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.59 for significance at the 0.05
level and must exceed  0.50 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:
 
  We tested the same wines as the night before. Each bottle had about 20
  hours to breathe. We corrected the mistake with the Busch Spaetlese and
  inserted a Busch Auslese. It was also opened the night before. Everybody
  agreed that it is much easier to the strengths and weaknesses (although
  all of us had a hard night). Maybe this is the reason for the higher
  correlations among the judges than the night before. The theory was
  proposed that the correlation might have been much higher if the wines had
  been opened 3 or 4 days before the tasting (see the October tasting).
