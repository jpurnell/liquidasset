<div class=body>Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):<br><br>    W = 0.0569<br><br>The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation is rather large, 0.8808. Most analysts would say that unless this probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly related.<br><br>We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group preference.<br>A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a perfect predictor of the group's preferences.<br>A 0.0 means no correlation, while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group. This is measured by the correlation R.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering. The Friedman Chi-Square value is  2.388. The probability that this could happen by chance is  0.881.</div>
<div class=body>We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correlations that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.<br><br></div>
<div class=body>Pairwise Rank Correlations<br><br>Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.753 for significance at the 0.05 level, and must exceed  0.676 for significance at the 0.10 level.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>COMMENT:<br><br>The Dominus estate, first known as the Napanook vineyard, dates back to the mid 19th century, with its vineyards likely planted around 1836 by founder George C Yount. Christian Moueix looking for a Californian winery identified Dominus Estate as the pick of the bunch and entered into partnership in 1982 with the then-owners Robin Lail and Marcia Smith before becoming the sole owner in 1995.<br>Overall this was a marvelous tasting of somewhat old school classic style of Napa Cabernet Sauvignon wines. they were extremely enjoyable. For most of the tasters this was the first time they have enjoyed a vertical of this winery. They were considered atypical for today’s Napa wines with more restrained fruit and an almost Bordeaux style. It is a food friendly style that appears to be capable of further aging, given that the wines apart from a slight difference in color showed little signs of age. While there was no significant difference between these wines it’s worth noting that the top two wines were individually rated 99 and 100 points. There is a second wine Napanook and a third called Othello. <br>The winery is often used in blind tasting against Bordeaux wines, Dominus’ grand vin – a variable blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc – is born of the estate’s unique volcanic terroir, 25-year-old vines and commitment to authentic Bordeaux-style winemaking practices. The production at 7,000 cases also puts it in a similar size to mid sized top Bordeaux chateau’s with pricing that is reasonable when compared to some of the more rarified pricing from comparable boutique Napa wineries.</div>
