<p><font size="+1"><font size="+1">What is new on this page? Reports 230 through 240 have recently been added, 
as have Book Reviews 9 and 10. An obituary for our friend Dwight Jaffee was added as Feature 7 in the "Features" section.
In addition, we have discovered some very old wine tasting notes that were prepared in the early days of
WINETASTER<sup>&reg;</sup>. All those report that were complete or could be reconstructed have now been added to the
tasting reports. Click on Tasting Reports and read the new Preamble to see how they are arranged on the website. In addition, we have introduced 
an Index to all the wines. Click on Index of Wines in the Table of Contents. The new Index indexes all the wines ever tasted and
provides links to all the reports in which they are mentioned. Finally, a new report was added under &quot;Vineyard Reviews.&quot;
 
</p>
<p>The reader may have noticed that we have not posted any tasting since April 2020. The reason for the hiatus is the Covid-19 pandemic during which we have largely sequestered ourselvesd
and have held no wine tastings. Recently one of out members has figured out how wines to be tasted could be decanted into mini-bottles and distriuted to the members of the group
while maintaining appropriate social distancing. On the strength of this modest innovation we have resumed wine tasting
with the aid of Zoom. The latest tasting was again an in-person tasting.</font></p>
