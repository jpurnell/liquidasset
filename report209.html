 We now measure the amount of correlation (W) among the judges:
 W = 1.0 => perfect correlation, W = 0 => no correlation
<br>
 We also provide a probability measure that this correlation is due to chance
<br>
 In this case the correlation is =     0.1384
<br>
 Probability that correlation is due to chance = 0.3552
<br>
  We compute the correlation of each taster with the average ranking of the oth-
 ers. 1.0 => perfect correlation, 0 => no correl., -1.0 => total disagreement

  Comments:
<br>
This was a most memorable tasting. We have never before had another tasting with such a star-studded cast of
characters. We might characterize is as a historic tasting and it was a privilege to taste such great wines from the 
same vintage.

The Leroy wines turned out very well and held their own against the group consisting of the Roman&euml;e Conti and Comte 
de Vogu&euml; wines. They all still tasted young and we may note that the two most famous Richebourgs underperformed and 
that the La Tache did not rise above the flock. Some tasters detexted a touch of oxidation that may have affected the 
overall evaluations. All these wines were characterized by the sweetness for which the greatest Burgundies are known.
