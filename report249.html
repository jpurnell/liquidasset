<div class=body>Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):<br><br>    W = 0.1815<br><br>The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation is rather large, 0.1793. Most analysts would say that unless this probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly related.<br><br>We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group preference.<br>A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a perfect predictor of the group's preferences.<br>A 0.0 means no correlation, while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group. This is measured by the correlation R.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering. The Friedman Chi-Square value is 10.167. The probability that this could happen by chance is  0.179.</div>
<div class=body>We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correlations that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.<br><br></div>
<div class=body>Pairwise Rank Correlations<br><br>Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.705 for significance at the 0.05 level, and must exceed  0.626 for significance at the 0.10 level.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>COMMENT:<br><br>Overall the wines, despite the wide spreading in age were all very enjoyable. There appeared to be a bifurcation in the preferences between young and older wines between the tasters but they were all enjoyable. The wines were clearly identifiable as Bordeaux’s and it is interesting how well the younger wines were enjoyable now. Many of these younger wines were from good vintages and maybe made in a more approachable style. This was helped in this tasting by the younger wines being ‘second’ wines, made for earlier drinking.<br>The second wine of Rouget was 87% Merlot, making it very approachable. <br>The Reignac which is primarily 67% Merlot 25% Cab was the second preference and represented the best overall value, perhaps not being from one of the more recognized areas helps this.<br></div>
