 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2478
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0960. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine C is Hermitage La Sizeranne 1990       
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine D is Hermitage La Sizeranne 1988       
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine E is Hermitage La Chapelle 1989

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 12.1429. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0960

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This was an extremely memorable tasting. 
                                   
  Fact 1 is that the 1988 La Chapelle was not in good condition. Fact 2 is that in
  this group the 1985 vintage performed less well than the other three.     
  One opinion is that great Syrrah and, parenthetically, Nebbiolo-based wines 
  provide more satisfying and complex taste experiences than most Cabernet  
  or Merlot based wines. And a big part of that is that these are food-friendly
  wines, and we were served some excellent food with them. Overall, the     
  tasting reminded us of how enjoyable the Hermitage wines are. We also performed
  the appropriate significance test to see whether in the aggregate the La Chapelle's 
  better or worse than the La Sizeranne's. The test is based on the quantity 
  
  					R = (R<sub>1</sub>/n<sub>1</sub>)/(R<sub>2</sub>/n<sub>2</sub>)
					
  where R<sub>i</sub> and n<sub>i</sub> are the sum of the rank-sums and the number of
  items in the i<sup>th</sup> group (4 in this case for each group). R turns out to be
  1.1356, which is not significant from the mean value, and hence neither group of wines
  is statistically superior to the other.
