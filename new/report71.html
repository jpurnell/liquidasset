 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2478
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0644. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine B is Ch. Cheval Blanc 1990

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 11.8929. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0644
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is   0.4076. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.5710 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The wines tasted different later in the tasting than earlier. The wines   
  that seemed quite open at the outset appeared to be more closed in later  
  on. These wines are all very young and there are not many meaningful      
  differences. Everyone in the room agreed with this; we all agreed that the
  wines are likely to get better in the future.                             
                                                                            
  We tasted these wines two years ago and it is interesting to compare the results 
  to what we concluded in September of 2001. At that tasting (see <a href="report47.html">Report47.html</a> 
  one of our regular members was absent and was replaced by a guest. As a result,
  we can examine tasters' intertemporal consistency for only seven tasters. Moreover,
  the present tasting did not have a Ch. Margaux 1990; hence the rankings of the September 2001
  tasting were reranked by omitting the wine missing from the later tasting.
  
  The Spearman Rho rank correlation coefficient between the aggregate tasting results in the 
  two tastings is 0.6667,which may superficially seem impressive, but is not statistically 
  significant from zero.
  
  We next computed the Spearman Rho coefficients for each individual taster who took part in 
  each of the two tastings. Five of the seven coefficients were positive, two were negative.
  With one exception, none of them was statistically significantly different from zero. The
  one exception was the coefficient 0.9286, with a z-value of 2.2745, obtained by Orley.
  
  It is our intention to retaste these wines every two years as long as we can.
