                              Number of Judges =  8
                              Number of Wines  =  8

<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1949
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1423. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine H is Ch. Mouton Rothschild
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine G is Ch. Leoville Poyferre
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine C is Ch. La Lagune 1970
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine F is Ch. La Lagune 1970
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine D is Ch. Brane Cantenac
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine A is Ch. Beychevelle 1970
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine E is Ch. Haur Brion 1970

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 10.9167. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1423

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

                           Pairwise Rank Correlations

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  We have been tasting these wines for 12 years. We all agree that the wines
  are lighter and have less fruit than in the past. However, none is over
  hill.

  The winetasting was unusual, because two of the wines were identical---
  taken from the same magnum, so there was no possible bottle variability.
  Of the seven people who did not know which were the identical wines,
  two people were able to tell which were the same wines (which is a
  little better than what you would expect by chance). However, in the
  tasters' rankings, the gap in the ranking between the identical wines was
  only one rank unit for four of the seven tasters and no more than three
  rank units for anyone (and this is also slightly better than chance).

  One of the oddities is that wine D (the Brane Cantenac) had a bimodal
  distribution of ranks, with several people ranking it first and several
  ranking it last.
