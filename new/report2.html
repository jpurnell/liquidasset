Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
 
     W = 0.4601
 
 
The probability that random chance could be responsible for this
correlation is quite small, 0.0001. Most analysts would say that unless 
this probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not
strongly  related.
 
We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with
the group preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's
preferences are a perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no
correlation, while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the
group.

Comments by Orley Ashenfelter--Tasting held March 2, 1998:        
             
This was our third tasting of 1970 red Bordeaux.  The completely
general view was that these wines are now starting to lose their fruit and fade.
In a previous tasting I believe that the Cheval Blanc and Ducru were the
top wines, but in this tasting only  the Cheval Blanc really still shines. 
The Brane Cantenac has always been a major ringer.  It was rated 65 points by
Robert Parker, but has never peformed lower than the middle of the pack in
any of our tastings.  In fact, in the earliest tasting, some 10 years ago,
it was ranked first by the group!  The Bois de Notre Dame was inserted as
a ringer by me: I bought it at an auction a decade ago, and it has been a
delicious wine. Frank Prial of the New York Times and I drank a bottle some years
ago in New York and Frank went so far as to write about it as an example of an
auction bargain--as, of course, the Brane Cantenac has been too.  Sadly,
this bottle of Bois de Notre Dame (a producer I have never seen again) was
oxidized, and clearly the worst wine in the tasting.  Two nights later I pulled
one of my last bottles out of the cellar and it was delicious. 
Drink up! </pre>
