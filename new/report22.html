 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.4643
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0104. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine F is Beaulieu Vineyard Reserve 1996
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine G is Williams Selyem 1992
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine A is Chambertin 1981
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine D is Romanee-st-Vivant 1988
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine C is Haute Cabrieres 1995
  6.   tied for  6th place    Wine B is Hospice de Beaune 1983
  7.   tied for  6th place    Wine E is Mount Eden Pinot Noir 1991

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 16.7143. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0104

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

                           Pairwise Rank Correlations

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  First, we note that in this tasting there were three French, three
  American and one South African (Haute-Cabrieres) Pinot Noir wines.
  All wines were considered extraordinarily good, but there was remark-
  able agreement on the quality of the BV Reserve 1996 Pinot Noir.
  The wine, in a very fancy bottle, is from Carneros and aged in French oak
  barrels. The winner tasted like an outstanding red Burgundy. The winning
  wine was incredibly rich and smooth. The wines were nevertheless very
  close in terms of appeal, and it is interesting that the South African
  held its own in a strong field.

  Another thing we did in this tasting was to identify which wine came
  from which country. Each judge was asked to record his guesses by
  identifying each wine A, B, C, etc., with the letters A for American, F for
  French, and S for South African. Each judge was required to identify
  exactly three wines as American, three as French and one as South
  African (otherwise one could automatically identify three wines
  correctly by guessing every wine to be French or every wine to be
  American).

  The table below shows the identifications picked by the judges:

   When can we say that a judge's identifications are statistically
   significant? It can be calculated that on the assumption that
   judges identify wines randomly, the number of correct identifica-
   tions will occur with the following probabilities:

                     Number corrrectly       Probability of
                        identified             occurrence

                             0                   0.043
                             1                   0.136
                             2                   0.257
                             3                   0.321
                             4                   0.129
                             5                   0.107
                             6                   0.0
                             7                   0.007

  Note that it is impossible ever to identify exactly six wines
  correctly (because if six are correctly identified, the seventh
  is automatically also identified correctly). In any event, to
  be statistically significant (at the 0.114 level), a judge has to
  identify at least five wines correctly. Note that if the number of
  wines of type A, F and S is not 3, 3, 1 but some other numbers, the
  statistical distribution above no longer applies but has to be
  computed anew. For some other interesting examples, take a look at
