     ( 5 is the best possible,  40 is the worst)

<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1543
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.6113. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R. We also show the correlation between 
 each judge's rankings and the prices of the wines.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is Chehalem 2000                     
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine E is Chehalem 2002                     
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine G is Domaine Drouhin 2003              
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine C is Argyle Nuthouse Willamette 2000   
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine F is Chehalem 2004                     
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine H is Mt. Difficulty  2005 (New Zealand)
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine A is Adelsheim Elisabeth Reserve 2005  
  8.   ........  8th place    Wine B is Archery Summit Arcus Estate 2001  

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  5.4000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.6113
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is  -0.2515. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.5240 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Overall, these were surprisingly enjoyable and uniform wines. The Archery 
  Summit Arcus wine was the most expensive and received the worst          
  score, while the Chehalem wines did extremely well, garnering first and second place. 
  But it would be very difficult for most people to distinguish the Archery Summit   
  from wines one half or one third of the price. A question was asked: could
  anyone really tell the New Zealand wine apart from the others? Answer:    
  no. The significance of the agreement among the judges was about the      
  lowest ever among the judges. The Chehalem wines were from designated     
  vineyards and would be very hard to buy in any vintage except off their   
  mailing list. Embedded in our tasting, without the tasters knowing it,    
  were two wines bottled with screwcaps. They were the 2004 Chehalem        
  3Vineyard Pinot Noir and the Mt. Difficulty 2004 New Zealand wine.   
  These were the two least expensive wines in the group. For the price,     
  one taster said he would rather be drinking French pinot noirs. But it is noteworthy
  that ten years ago Oregon Pinot Noirs acidic and unpleasant, whereas they are now 
  very good and their price is largely the same, in the $30 - $40 range.
