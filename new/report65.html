 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3594
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0053. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine C is David Bruce 2000 Russian River Cal
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine D is Hamilton Russell 1998 South Africa
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine G is Mt. Difficulty 2000 Otego New Zeal
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine H is King Estate 1999 Oregon           
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine B is Spy Valley 2001 Marlborough New Ze

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 20.1250. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0053
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is   0.0000. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.5240 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  We all agreed that the wines were well-made and were drinkable. They all  
  cost all in the same ball park. Almost all had the typically spicy nose   
  earthy terroir. We had with us the marketer of three of the wines, and    
  she able to correctly select two of the three---both of which were from   
  New Zealand. The Greenhough is a bit green, slightly hot and will age well
  The David Bruce, the only California Pinot, was also the only wine with   
  vanilla, oaky notes.
