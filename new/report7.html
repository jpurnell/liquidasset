     ( 6 is the best possible,  42 is the worst)
<br>
<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2024
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2952. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine C is Bandol-Tempier 1975               
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   tied for  2nd place    Wine A is Bandol-Tempier 1986 La Migoua     
  3.   tied for  2nd place    Wine G is Bandol-Tempier 1978               
  4.   tied for  4th place    Wine B is Bandol-Tempier 1992               
  5.   tied for  4th place    Wine F is Bandol-Tempier 1989 La Tourtine   
  6.   tied for  6th place    Wine E is Bandol-Tempier 1986 La Tourtine   
  7.   tied for  6th place    Wine D is Bandol-Tempier 1987 La Tourtine   

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  7.2857. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.2952

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Very fruity wines, remind you of Chateauneuf du Pape; half the group      
  thought they were nicer than Chateauneuf du Pape, half did not. Almost    
  everyone thought that the 1975 was a particularly good example, but the   
  wines were universally delicious. Burt says they were good, not delicious.
