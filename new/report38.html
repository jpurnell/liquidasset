 <div align="center"><font size="+2"><b>Wine Tasting-The Top Chilean Cabernets (and one ringer)</b></font></div>
<div align="center">Introductory Comments by Orley Ashenfelter</div>

	This is a comparison of the top Chilean cabernet sauvignon wines, with one ringer thrown in from 
	California to provide a benchmark.  Chile is known for reasonably priced red wines.  But in the last 
	few years there has also been an attempt to produce handcrafted wines from outstanding low-yielding 
	vineyards, using international wine making technology.

	<font size="+1"><font color="cc3333">A Good Place to Try the Wines</font></font>: Café Atlantico, Washington, D.C.:  A good place try many of 
these wines is an outstanding restaurant in Washington, D.C., Café Atlantico, which is essentially a Nouvelle 
Latin American inspired place with a fabulous Latin American wine list.

	<font size="+1"><font color="cc3333">Joint Ventures</font></font>:  Some of these wines are joint ventures with European (Rothschild) or American 
(Mondavi) firms.  Others use outside consultants, while some depend on local expertise.
	
	<font size="+1"><font color="cc3333">Prices</font></font>:  Prices are high for these wines, and the wines can be hard to obtain. None 
of the wines sells for less than $40 (with one exception) and many are more expensive.  A key question is 
whether the quality of the wines justifies the prices.
	
	<font size="+1"><font color="cc3333">Wine Writer Evaluation</font></font>: Many of these wines have met with 
remarkable approval from the wine press. See the notes below for the ratings I could find.

<font size="+1"><font color="cc3333">The Wines</font></font>:<br>
<p>	<b>Almaviva 1997</b> ($70). This wine is the result of a joint venture between the Concha y Toro firm and the 
	Mouton's Rothschild family. Parker rated this wine a 91, and provided the usual comparison to black 
	currants, blackberries and other fruits and nuts. </p><p>
	<b>Clos Apalta 97 </b>($60). Crafted by French consultant 	Michel Rolland, this is the top wine from Casa 
	Lapostolle. I found this the most difficult wine to obtain.  Also rated in the 90's by Parker, this 
	one is called  a "triumph of wine-making."</p><p>
	<b>Montes Alpha M 98 </b>($55). This wine seems to be a product of the Montes group and I have found no 
	indication of an outside consultant being used.</p><p>
	<b>Sena 97</b> ($40). This wine is a result of a collaboration between the Chilean Chadwick family and the 
	Californian Mondavi family. This is the 3rd joint venture (the Italian Frescobaldi and French 
	Rothschild ventures are the other two) the Mondavi family has developed.</p><p>
	<b>Cousino-Macul Finis Terrae 96</b> ($25). This is the least expensive wine in the tasting. It was included 
	to provide a comparison of the top wine from the Cousino-Macul (a well know, large producer) wine with 
	the others.</p><p>
	<b>Gallo Northern Sonoma Estate 96 </b>($50). This is the ringer wine. It is the top of the line wine made 
	by the Gallo family in their astounding new estate in Sonoma. This wine was the winner of the monster 
	tasting of the top 1996 California cabernets (see the results at www.liquidasset.com, tasting no. 35), 
	and it bested the likes of Harlan Estate, Screaming Eagle, and the like. In order for the high Chilean 
	prices to make sense the wines should, on the whole, be at the same quality level as this sleeper 
	California cabernet.</p>

 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3696
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0113. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 14.7857. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0113

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The prices of wines A to E are high and relatively similar. Wine F is     
  significantly less expensive. Our rankings line up fairly well with that  
  division. Everyone agreed that the wines were all of excellent quality.   
  So, it is probably fair to say that the prices reflect quality in this    
  group of wines.                                                           
  The wines were notably rich, with high levels of glycerine. However,      
  they were lacking in complex bouquets.                                    
  The wines that scored the best reflected the influence of either joint    
  venture or other European influence.                                      
  The wines are likely to get better with age, but are drinking well early.
