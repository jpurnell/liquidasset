 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.4299
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0117. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine G is Caymus-Special Selection 1995     
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   tied for  2nd place    Wine B is Caymus-Special Selection 1994     
  3.   tied for  2nd place    Wine A is Caymus-Special Selection 1998     
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine D is Caymus-Special Selection 1997     
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine H is Caymus-Special Selection 1992     
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine E is Caymus-Napa 1990                  
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine F is Caymus-Special Selection 1982

  8.   ........  8th place    Wine C is Caymus-Napa 1978                  

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 18.0556. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0117
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is   0.1677. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.5240 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Based on our tasting, there is some evidence that the younger wines       
  performed better than the older ones. But, all the wines were of excellent
  quality. Unfortunately, we do not have a very well designed experiment    
  for determining whether the Special Selection wines are superior to the   
  regular wines, because the regular wines were in the older category. Our  
  impression on the basis of all this is that the Napa is not as good as the
  Special Selection. We were very lucky to have our host provide current    
  price estimates for the wines. The correlation between the group ranking  
  and the prices was not very high, but at least positive. Our last place   
  wine, C, is heavily discounted and might be attractive as a dinner wine.  
  As Robert Parker says, "Never unapproachable, the Special Selections      
  taste almost too delicious when released. This has given rise to          
  criticism that the wines will not last." We think these comments are too  
  harsh, but our tasting results support them.
