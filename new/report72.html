 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1711
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2134. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine B is Ch. Margaux '97
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine A is Ch. Gruaud Larose '97
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine F is Ch. Ducru Beaucaillou '97
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine C is Ch. Lynch Bages '97
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine G is Ch. Pichon Lalande '97
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine E is Carruades de Ch. Lafite '97
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine D is Ch. La-Fleur Petrus '97
---------------------------------------------------
  8.   ........  8th place    Wine H is Ch. Prieure Lichine '97

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  9.5833. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.2134
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is  -0.0714. At the
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of
  0.5240 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

                           Pairwise Rank Correlations

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

<p> Comments:<br>
The relatively poor showing of the Ch. Prieure Lichine confirmed the
view we have had of this wine in previous tastings. But all the wines
were very drinkable, in fact
rather extraordinary wines. All were very nice drinking now but many, Margaux and Ducru for sure, 
for considerable keeping. They may be like the '53s, drinking well from start to finish. 
Overpriced at the outset, these wines can now be real bargains. Prieure, the '97 vintage from before Sasha Lichine lost it finally, 
was as bad as many of us remembered the wines of this chateau from vintages of the past. There was also 
a feeling that the Gruaud Larose tasted well and was a
reasonable bargain (under $40) and that all the wines would probably
improve.
