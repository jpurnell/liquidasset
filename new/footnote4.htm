In informal wine tastings, it may be difficult to remove all traces
of this effect if, for example, the organizer of the wine tasting, who is
responsible for decanting bottles a
nd assigning code letters to them, participates in the tasting. Even if he
 makes no effort to remember which code letter corresponds to which wine,
 it may well be the case that some residual memory affects his ratings.<br>
