<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3382
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0126. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is Cote Rotie La Mouline 1988
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine B is Cote Rotie La Mouline 1985
  3.   tied for  3rd place    Wine F is Cote Rotie La Landonne 1988
  4.   tied for  3rd place    Wine E is Cote Rotie La Turque 1988
  5.   tied for  5th place    Wine A is Cote Rotie La Landonne 1985
  6.   tied for  5th place    Wine G is Cote Rotie La Mouline 1983
---------------------------------------------------
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine C is Cote Rotie La Landonne 1983

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 16.2321. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0126

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

                           Pairwise Rank Correlations

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Even before the ranking were obtained, one taster said that these wines
  were awesomely majestic. Although it was extremely difficult to
  rank-order these wines, it was quite surprising that the correlation
  among the tasters was statistically highly significant. Several tasters
  thought that the 1983s were fading ever so slightly. Nevertheless, these
  wines were deemed to be about as good as wines ever get. The 1983s should
  probably be drunk now. The 1985s have none of the herbal character that
  some tasters find annoying (and others like), while the 1988s seem very
  concentrated. Robert Parker says "the 1988s are even richer than the
  extraordinary 1985s and more concentrated than the magnificent 1983s."
  We agree with this assessment, and we don't always agree by any means.
  These wines combine the extraordinary softness and texture of the greatest
  Burgundies with the intensity and extract of the greatest French, Italian
  and California cabernets. Note that all the wines received 100 points from
  Parker, except for the 1983 La Landonne, which received 98+. We
  finally note that some people expected big differences across the
  vineyards, while the big differences were actually across the
  vintages.
