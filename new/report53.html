 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.4971
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0019. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine A is Volnay Santenots ??               
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine E is Nuits Saint Georges Michelot '64  
  3.   tied for  3rd place    Wine F is Gevrey Chambertin Combe aux Moines
  4.   tied for  3rd place    Wine G is Gevrey Chambertin Piat '66        
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine C is Pommard Clos de la Platiere '62

  6.   ........  6th place    Wine B is Clos de la Boudriau ??            
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine D is Chambolle Musigny Grivelet '62    

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 20.8776. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0019

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  There are three facts we can all agree on (1) These wines were part of a  
  large purchase from a widow, whose husband enjoyed buying wine but not    
  drinking it; (2) We opened 15 bottles to find 7 that were not oxidized    
  badly; (3) However, when the wines managed to survive our initial scrutiny
  all agreed they were quite delicious --- except for those 2 that were     
  slightly oxidized.                                                        
  We also had as part of the same cellar a 1962 Martin Ray pinot noir.      
  This wine, which was not oxidized, was so acidic as to be unpleasant at   
  40 years of age.                                                          
  This tasting conclusively proves the old saying: "there are no old wines  
  just old bottles."                                                        
  Frank disagrees with this assessment and feels that we did have some bad  
  wines today.
