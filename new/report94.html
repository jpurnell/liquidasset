 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1924
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2233. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is Ch. Petrus 1961                   
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine E is Ch. Petrus 1978                   
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine C is Ch. Petrus 1982

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  9.4286. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.2233

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This was an extraordinary tasting of the most extraordinary wines;     
  every one of them was delicious and it was very difficult to distinguish  
  between the various wines, which is supported by the low correlation      
  among the tasters. Age has its advantage with the exception of 1982, which
  is either old before its time or a wine of unbelievable potential. These  
  are wines clearly built for long haul perfect balance between fruit and   
  tannins. That may explain why the 1989 and the 1990 have not come into    
  their own. The great face-off between the the wines rated 100 by          
  Parker ('61, '89, '90) are decided by age. It is also noteworthy that     
  the wine rated second best by this group was rated lowest among these    
  wines by Parker,
