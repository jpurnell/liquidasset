 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2177
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1538. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine E is Clos de Vougeot Mongeard-Mugneret 
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine F is Clos de Vougeot Rene Engel 1990

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 10.6667. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1538

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  All agreed that these were extraordinry wines. They combine richness,     
  elegance and focus to remarkably high degree. The distinctions center on  
  (1) nose and (2) degree of spice in the flavors. Most of us agreed that   
  our rankings were a matter of personal taste rather than objectives       
  measures of quality. The average scores of the 1989s and the 1990s do not 
  appear to be very different (33 for 1989 and 30 for 1990), although in the
  pairwise contests the 1990s won.                                          
                                                                            
  Both vintages are proving the longevity of the Burgundy vintages of these 
  two years.
