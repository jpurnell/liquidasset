 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3238
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0837. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine B is Le Bonheur Carbernet 1995         
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine A is Plaisir de Merle Cabernet 1995    
  3.   tied for  3rd place    Wine F is Thelema Cabernet 1995             
  4.   tied for  3rd place    Wine D is Kaapzicht Pinotage Reserve 1997   
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine E is Nederburg Private Bin R 103 1989  
---------------------------------------------------
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine C is Hartenberg Shiraz 1995            

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  9.7143. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0837

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 <p>COMMENT:</p>

  <p>These wines were much better than anyone at the table expected. The       
  wines to the best of our knowledge are not widely available in the United States 
  with the exception of the Thelema. These wines appeared      
  to differ from one another to a greater degree than representative        
  bottles in our tastings. The prices ranged from $5 for A to $15 for E     
  and F. E had a noticeably sweeter fruit character, but not because of     
  sugar. The wines are drinking noticeably well now, in spite of their      
  youth. The wines were brought directly from South Africa, and prices may  
  be higher if they have to go through the three-tier distribution system.</p>
