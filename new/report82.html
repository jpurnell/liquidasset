 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.6968
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0000. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine C is Ch. Leoville Poyferre 1970        
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine A is Ch. Ducru Beaucaillou 1977        
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine D is Ch. Prieure Lichine 1976

  4.   ........  4th place    Wine B is Ch. Prieure Lichine 1975          
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine G is Ch. Cos D'Estournel 1975

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 34.1429. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0000

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  We have an unusual amount of agreement within the group. On the whole, two
  groups, namely, wines A, B, C, D on the one hand, and wines E, F, G, H on 
  the other. It is noteworthy that F, G, and H had poor corks and had to    
  with great difficulty. E and F were clearly oxidized. It is particularly  
  interesting that the Ducru, from 1977, which was the least distinguished  
  vintage in tis group, did so excellently. On the whole, these wines       
  should be drunk forthwith. It is also very interesting that the Prieure is
  in the top group with both of its entries. It was also pleasantly sur-    
  prising that these wines had help up as well as they did. It is further   
  interesting that only one of the 1970s made it into the top four wines.
