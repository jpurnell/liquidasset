 We now measure the amount of correlation (W) among the judges: 
 W = 1.0 => perfect correlation, W = 0 => no correlation

 We also provide a probability measure that this correlation is due to chance

 In this case the correlation is =     0.3269

 Probability that correlation is due to chance = 0.0025



 We now measure the amount of correlation (C) among the wine-identifications
 of the judges:C = 1.0 => perfect correlation, C = 0 => no correlation
 We also provide a probability measure that this correlation is due to chance

 In this case the correlation is =     1.0000

 Probability that correlation is due to chance is < 5 %



 We now compute two correlations for each taster:(1)  R, which is the correla-
 tion of a taster's ranking with the average ranking of the others, (2) I,
 which is the correlation of each taster's wine identification with
 the TRUE  identification of the wines. R can have values from 1.0 (perfect
 correlation) to -1.0 (perfect disagreement) and I can have values from 1.0
 (perfect match with the truth) to 0 (no match)

Remarks:<br> 
<p>We tested the same wines as the night before. Each bottle had 
about 20 hours time to breathe. We corrected the mistake with the 
Busch Spaetlese*** and inserted a Busch Auslese. It was also 
opened the night before. Everybody agreed that it is 
much easier to the strengths and weaknesses of the 
wines (although all of us had a hard night). Maybe this is the 
reason for the higher correlation among the judges than the night 
before. The theory was proposed that the correlation might have been much 
higher if the wines had been opened 3 or 4 days before 
the tasting (see the October 1998 tasting). </p>
