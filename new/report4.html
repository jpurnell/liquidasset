  Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
 
     W = 0.1793
 
  The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2745. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 
  We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.

  COMMENT:
<br>
  Tasting on March 30, 1998--Comments by Orley Ashenfelter                  
  The main comment about these wines regarded their consistency.            
  Surprisingly, the 1985 was disliked (relatively) to the others, and some  
  thought it was a corked bottle.  At least one taster (strongly)           
  disagreed.  The wines were a pleasure to drink, and everyone agreed that  
  either the 1985 was too young, or simply flawed.  Perhaps the 1988        
  is underrated in the scheme of things, but virtually all the wines were   
  wonderful to drink today.  Surprising to some, the ratings in this tasting
  were virtually the opposite of the way the prices are arrayed in the      
  auctions, and the way that the best known rater rates the wines.          <br>
