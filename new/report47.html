 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1838
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1726. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 10.2917. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1726

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  These were all extraordinary wines and it was surprising that for young   
  wines they had unusually little tannin. One participant felt that the     
  wines are drinking beautifully but have substantial tannins which are soft
  and sweet. In the four comparisons of vintages for the same chateaux, in  
  three cases the 1990 was preferred. The first place wine was the 1990     
  La Conseillante and the least preferred wine was the 1989 Lafite. The 1990
  Margaux was in fifth place and was a 100 point Parker rated wine in 1993. 
  Based on the across the board performance for the two vintages, La        
  Conseillante was the winner and Lafite was last.
