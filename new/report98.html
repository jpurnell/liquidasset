 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1235
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.3526. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

Comments:

 First, we should say that the astute reader of these notes may have noticed that there were two
 identical bottles of Vieux Telegraph 2000 included in the tasting. This was an accident that not even 
 the host of the tasting was aware of until the covers were removed from the wines. The host's 
 intention had been to include a bottle of Ch. de Beaucastel 2000 instead of a Vieux Telegraph 2000 again.
 All the wines were  in fine condition and no bottle was corked or otherwise spoiled; under ideal 
 circumstances the two identical bottles of Vieux Telegraph 2000 should have been ranked very close to 
 each other in the tasting. This did not happen: one of these bottles was ranked worst, and the other 
 was ranked third best in the aggregate. In fact, four judges ranked these wines either adjacent to each 
 other or next to adjacent; the other five ranked them farther apart.
 <br>
 The 2001 vintage in Chateauneuf du Pape is reputed to be not quite ready and rather tannic; we did not 
 find this to be the case and all the wines were drinking well. They were sufficiently similar in quality
 that the ranking was not statistically sifgnificant. But it is noteworthy that the two highest rankings 
 went to the two bottles of Clos des Papes. All the wines with one exception were in the same price range
 (around $50 a bottle) with the exception of Domaine Bois de Boursan, which cost $125; while it ranked 
 among the top six wines (which were nearly indistinguishable in terms of the rankings), it was not 
 the clear winner.
