     ( 7 is the best possible,  70 is the worst)

<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2782
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0411. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine J is CloudyBay 97
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine D is Villa Maria NZ 97

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 17.5247. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0411

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in
the left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

                           Pairwise Rank Correlations

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.65 for significance at the 0.05
level and must exceed  0.56 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Kai: New Zealands wines are absolutely parfumed, without any elegance
  Tement's wine is considered to be almost a French wine, the real
  outstanding wine is: Bourgois Sancerre, the other French wines were
  nothing special
  Wolfgang: Pichler is an example how to kill a wine with oak.
  Amazing is the Villa Maria because of its non-over-parfumed flavour
  Pascale: New Zealand are too straight
  Karl: It is hard to taste these different wines agains one another.
  The styles are too different.
