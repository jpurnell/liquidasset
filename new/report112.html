 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.5520
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0406. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine C is Ch. Palmer 1990                   
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine B is Ch. Haut Brion 1989               
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine A is Ch. Haut Brion 1990               
---------------------------------------------------
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine D is Ch. Palmer 1989                   

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  8.2800. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0406
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is   0.3162. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  1.0000 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  1.00 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  All of the wines were really quite excellent. As we say in British horse  
  racing, there was little to choose among them. The tasting proves that    
  these wines are now approachable, soft and ready to drink. In this        
  tasting we had the incredibly famous 1989 Haut Brion. We thought it was   
  good and hung right in the pack. This says to us that the 1990 Palmer     
  could be a great buy. Of course, 1989 and 1990 are two of the truly       
  remarkable vintages of the two decades.
