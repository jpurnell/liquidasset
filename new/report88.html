 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3296
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0101. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   tied for  1st place    Wine G is Pichon Longueville 1982

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 18.4583. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0101

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  These were all extraordinary wines and there was no bad bottle in the lot.
  Any other issues notwithstanding, the Pichon Lalande (wine G) is a brillant,   
  focused and pure wine which one taster has tasted  on at least 20 occasions       
  and never failed to love.                                                 
  Two of us could tell the minute we sat down which were the two wines      
  that were Pichon Lalande and Conseillante. We knew that because two of the
  wines were noticeably colder than the others, since they had come from 
  a different cellar and we knew they were colder. Those two wines scored   
  the highest in our tasting. Orley thought that the most highly rated wine 
  by Parker, and certainly the most expensive in today's mnarket, had the   
  green character of unripe cabernet as you would find in a market from     
  Monterey CA. Many of the group disagreed with this view.  
  One taster noted the following: These wines, bought for $15 and less per 
  bottle, now sell at auction for $300 down to about $100 per bottle. The 
  wines are very good, but few of us ever drink these on a regular basis 
  because of their current prices. Many knowledgeable wine people who bought 
  these wines early have now either sold them, or have certainly contemplated 
  doing so. As wine drinkers, we understand the motives of sellers, and we 
  wonder about the motives of buyers.”
