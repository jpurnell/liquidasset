                              Number of Judges =  9
                              Number of Wines  =  4

  Identification of the Wine:                   The judges' overall ranking:
<br>
  Wine A is Ch. Mouton Rothschild 1945                    ........  1st place
  Wine B is Ch. Latour 1953                               ........  4th place
  Wine C is Ch. Haut Brion 1961                           ........  3rd place
  Wine D is Ch. Ausone 1962                               ........  2nd place

<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3432
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0259. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine A is Ch. Mouton Rothschild 1945
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine D is Ch. Ausone 1962
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine C is Ch. Haut Brion 1961
---------------------------------------------------
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine B is Ch. Latour 1953

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  9.2667. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0259

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

                           Pairwise Rank Correlations

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05
level and must exceed  1.00 for significance at the 0.1 level

 <p>COMMENT:<br><br>

  We all agreed that all the wines were in outstanding condition and
  delicious to drink. The wines were served blind with filet mignon grilled
  over hickory wood and all were outstanding to drink now, inspite of
  Michael Broadbent's 1980 comment that the Latour should be drunk by 1993
  and the Ausone by 1985. The prices probably range from $4,000 per bottle
  to $500, the first place wine being the most expensive, and the second
  place wine the least. People who liked the Mouton least thought it had
  a medicinal character. Our host provided a bonus wine, 1961 Ch. Palmer.
  The wine was fresh, and delicious to drink also.<br><br>

  There are many people who claim that all these wines are too old; this
  tasting shows that that is not true.</p>
