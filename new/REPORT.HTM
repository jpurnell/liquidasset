 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1017
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.5476. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

We now compute for each wine the mean (average) grade it received from the judges
and the standard deviation of those grades. (The mean of, say, 3 grades is 
the sum of the grades divided by 3. The standard deviation is a measure of
the "dispersion" of the grades around the mean. The numbers 5, 6, and 7 and the
numbers 3, 6, and 9 both have the same mean of 6, but the second set has a
higher dispersion, i.e., strandard deviation.

We now compute the mean and the standard deviation for  each judge, from which
you can see which judge is harsh and which is lenient,  which thinks that the
wines are very different and which thinks they are pretty much the same.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.65 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.56 for significance at the 0.1 level

 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1543
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2039. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

We now compute for each wine the mean (average) grade it received from the judges
and the standard deviation of those grades. (The mean of, say, 3 grades is 
the sum of the grades divided by 3. The standard deviation is a measure of
the "dispersion" of the grades around the mean. The numbers 5, 6, and 7 and the
numbers 3, 6, and 9 both have the same mean of 6, but the second set has a
higher dispersion, i.e., strandard deviation.

We now compute the mean and the standard deviation for  each judge, from which
you can see which judge is harsh and which is lenient,  which thinks that the
wines are very different and which thinks they are pretty much the same.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.65 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.56 for significance at the 0.1 level
