<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A visit to
the Napa Valley is always a pleasure, and this book takes you on one.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Conaway’s new book about Napa is a kind of
sequel to his widely praised <i>Napa: The Story of an American Eden</i>, and it
will appeal to many of the same readers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>But this time the Eden has a blemish:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>disputes between vineyard developers and environmentalists.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The environmental disputes that
Conaway chronicles are set amid the backdrop of wealth and privilege that Napa
has become, but it introduces some new characters too.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On the one hand are wealthy newcomers like
Garen Staglin (an actual Democrat!), whose house was used in Disney’s remake of
<i>The Parent Trap</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But the
character that really fascinates Conaway is the suddenly wealthy
environmentalist Peter Mennen, heir to a fortune, but who is otherwise the
eccentric local postmaster.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Lurking in
the background, of course, are some of the old timers like Jack Cakebread,
whose “breakfast club” is portrayed as a right wing bunch of old coots who
slosh down sauvignon blanc with their scrambled eggs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Conaway tries to use the
environmental issues he encounters to weave a narrative around these characters
and at the same time convey some of the social and economic changes that have
assaulted the Napa Valley.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>One of the
most interesting of these changes is the invention of “cult” wines, made in
small quantities by super-star winemakers (most of whom are women) and sold by
mailing list for $100s per bottle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Many people in Napa were apparently
willing to speak on the record to Conaway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>But when it came to a discussion of the ubiquitous wine critic Robert
Parker’s coronation of these bottles of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>“rocket juice” the talk moved off the record.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Anonymous source “Pat” reports, “Everybody used to just let him
taste, until they realized that was the wrong way to do it, that you had to
talk to him and be very patient.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If he
tasted blind he wouldn’t come up with those findings.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Although he may not realize it, the findings aren’t impartial,
they’re engineered by the winemakers.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Although this anecdote demonstrates
the enhanced commercial role of wine critics, it also demonstrates the absence
of the old-time “mavericks” that Conaway identified in his first book.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For example, the last time I talked (and
tasted) with Joe Heitz, a man who always spoke his mind, I asked him what he
thought about the new cult wines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At
the time he was trying to recover from a second stroke (he never really did)
and it was apparent that he would not be saying very many words that day.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>His answer to my question:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>“10 percent grapes, 90 percent bullshit!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>That conversation with Joe and
Alice Heitz four years ago also demonstrates how badly out of date a book like
this can become before it is even published.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>At the time of our meeting, Silicon Valley money had moved to Napa
Valley and some vineyard prices had topped $100,000 per acre.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Alice wondered aloud if maybe <u>they</u>
should sell out!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They didn’t, but
Justin Meyer (Silver Oak), Bill and Joan Smith (La Jota), the Martinis, and
many other old-timers did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Since then
California grape prices have tanked and even first rate Napa producers will
say, at least privately, that this is a tough time to be in the wine business
if you need to make a living from it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>The Berkeley economist, Nobel Prize winner, and Napa grape grower Dan
McFadden acknowledged that the price of his super premium grapes had fallen
from $4,000 to $3,000 per ton in the last two years.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>In the wine business, the usual
rule of thumb is to price a bottle at one-hundredth the price of a ton of
grapes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With grape prices as low as
$200 a ton in some places it is no wonder that Trader Joe’s can make money with
its now infamous “two buck chuck” Charles Shaw brand, which sells for just $2 a
bottle.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>There are other problems with this
book as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Many of the best chapters
were written and published as magazine articles.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>If, like me, you first learned of vineyard owner Jason
Pahlmeyer’s tangle with the environmental police in Conaway’s article in <i>Outside</i>
magazine you will find it repeated here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>I also have many reservations about the accuracy of the reporting in
this book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>At a social function in San
Francisco I asked vineyard owner Clarke Swanson, reportedly a member of Jack
Cakebread’s “breakfast club,” whether sauvignon blanc <i>really</i> went well
with scrambled eggs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Swanson reminded
me of what I already knew: drinking at Napa business functions is discreet and
certainly not the norm at breakfast!</p>
