 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2407
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1824. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine F is Santino Satyricon 1996            
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine G is Qupe 1998

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 10.1111. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1824

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  These wines are all cleanly made, highly extracted, but with a wide range 
  of complexity levels. All of them are surprisingly accessible given the   
  facts that they are young and given the grape. On the whole, the          
  perception of the tasters was that the wines were not significantly       
  different. It is very interesting that the most expensive wine (E) turned 
  out to be in the middle of the pack and that of the two least expensive   
  wines ($9.95), one was ranked first and one was ranked last. In fact, computing 
  the rank correlation between the judges' rankings and the prices of the wines
  yields a Spearman Rho coefficient of only 0.1796, which is not statistically
  at even. 0.25 level.
