 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3207
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0279. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 15.7143. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0279

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This was an unbelievably wonderful tasting. Not a single oxidized bottle, 
  and some of the wines were of the same age as some of the drinkers. In    
  general, the wines were of extraordinarily high quality. The wines were   
  thought to be all good but nevertheless noticeably different, and in      
  particular, the 1975 was too acidic. The 1945 was in gorgeous condition   
  but was edged out by the 1959, also in terrific condition. Unlike what    
  some ill-informed critics will say, the 1966 was in terrific condition    
  and one of the top wines of the tasting---and is far and away the least   
  expensive wine served. Unlike some wines, these wines are quite different 
  from one another year by year. The wines reflect the vintages quite       
  accurately.  The vintages differ in terms of bouquet, acidity, fruit and  
  tannin. We note as a general conclusion that these wines should not be 
  drunk too young.
