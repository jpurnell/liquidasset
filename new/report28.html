 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):


     W = 0.6500




 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0003. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.


  1.   ........  1st place    Wine E is Deinhard, Oestricher Doosberg, Auslese 76
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine C is Schneider,Wehlener Klosterhofgut,Auslese 75
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine D is Hohe Domkirche,Scharzhofberger,Auslese 76
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine B is Schoenborn,Erbacher Marcobrunn,Sp&auml;tlese 71

  5.   ........  5th place    Wine A is nn,Wehlener Sonnenuhr,Sp&auml;tlese 71     

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 20.8000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0003

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.90 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Most tasters thought the first two wines were oxidized, gone.             
  ThDark Brown color appealed to others, who liked the shellack tone, esp B.
                                                                            
  This is the description of the first two, 1971 wines.                     
                                                                            
  There was a noticable gap between the first two wines and the last three. 
  At least from the point of view of many tasters!  Among the three highest 
  ranking wines, there was some agreement, but it was not terribly strong.  
                                                                            
  The Oestricher Doosberg 1976 was ranked first by virtually all tasters.   
  As as bonus we opened a 1971 Siebeldinger Koenigsgarten Beerenauslese,    
  which also had the &quot;Firn(e)&quot; character of the 1971s, but without any     
  objections to the quality!                                                
                                                                            
  The tasting makes it clear that 1971s of sp&auml;tlese level, depending on your
  tastes, should probably have been consumed by now.  It would be           
  interesting to see what a tasting of 1971 ausleses would show today.
