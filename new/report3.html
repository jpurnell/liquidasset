 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation:
 
     W = 0.1667
 
 
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.3916. Most analysist would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges preferences are not strongly related.
 
 We now analyze how each tasters'' preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster''s preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group''s preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.

 The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
 preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
 among the wines, they are separated by ------------------- and are judged to be 
 significantly different.

  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine C is Jos. Phelps Cab.1978

 Comments:
 
Comments by Orley Ashenfelter--tasting took place February 9, 1998:             
This was a tasting of 4 adjacent vintages of California cabernet sauvignon      
from a very reliable California producer in the 1970s.  All the wines were      
served in magnums blind.  These vintages in California (1976-79) have           
very different reputations for quality.  The goal was to see whether the        
vintages are really different.  The answer, felt strongly by all present,       
is no!  The wines were outstanding drinking and of remarkable consistency.      
However, these wines are ready to drink now.  I noticed after the tastng that   
my own ranks are perfectly predicted by the age of the wine:  I tended to like  
the slightly younger (and fresher) wines, somewhat to my own surprise!  Drink   
up.
