 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3048
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1035. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine B is Bois de Boursan 1989              
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine C is Boisdauphin 1990                  
  3.   tied for  3rd place    Wine A is Monpertuis 1990                   
  4.   tied for  3rd place    Wine D is Lucien Barrot 1990                
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine F is Lar Bernardine 1990               
---------------------------------------------------
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine E is Bousquet de Papes 1990            

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  9.1429. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1035

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  According one taster, the Lucien Barrot was distinctly different from the 
  other wines: it was a more interesting wine. General comments: 1. We all  
  agreed that the wines are mature and ready to drink and nothing is over   
  the hill. 2. We consumed them with sausages and firm cheeses and the      
  combination was irresistible. 3. The wines that were the winners were     
  the ones that were smoother and sweeter. 4. There is no tannin left in    
  these wines at all.
