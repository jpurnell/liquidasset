This immediately clarifies why the identification 
problem is <i>not</i> a simple binomial problem. One could have (mistakenly) 
thought that for each judge there is a probability <i>p</i> that they will identify 
a single wine correctly, and thus the probability of identifying <i>x</i> out of <i>n </i>
wines would just be [<i>n!/x!(n-x)!]p<sup>x</sup>(1-p)<sup>n-x</sup></i>. This is clearly incorrect for 
the case we are considering.<br>
