 We now measure the amount of correlation (W) among the judges:                 
 W = 1.0 => perfect correlation, W = 0 => no correlation                        
<br>
 We also provide a probability measure that this correlation is due to chance   

 In this case the correlation is =     0.2014                                   

 Probability that correlation is due to chance = 0.0494                         

We compute the correlation of each taster with the average ranking of the oth-  
ers and with prices. 1.0 => perfect, 0 => none, -1.0 => total disagreement

  Comments:
<br>
Everybody descried the Columbia Crest (F) as very sweet. The Sarget de Gruad-Larose
was decribed as approachable and having a licorice finish (Don)....             

We also took guesses which of the 8 wines were from France or Washington State, respectively. 
(We had 4 from each region). Most people guessed wrong 4 times.
Only Kyoko was wrong only twice. The wine that was mistaken most was the        
Chateau La Vieille Cure. Seven of us thought this wine were a WA state wine. 
Similarly, six judges thought wine D (Sarget de Gruaud-Larose) were a WA state wine. 
On the other hand, seven judges correctly identified wine B (Cahors) as a French wine.Interestingly, six 
people thought that the winner wine (Woodward Canyon from WA state)
were from France and even eight people thought that of the second winner (Gloria).
