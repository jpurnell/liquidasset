<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2420
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1054. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine B is J. Rochioli 1999 Pinot Noir Little
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine C is Kistler 1999 Pinot Noir Hirsch
---------------------------------------------------
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine H is Peter Michael 1999 Pinot Noir Moul
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine A is Richebourg 199 Leroy
  5.   tied for  5th place    Wine E is William Selyem 1999 Pinot Noir All
  6.   tied for  5th place    Wine F is Kistler 1999 Pinot Noir Cuvee Cath
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine G is Chambertin 1999 Leroy
  8.   ........  8th place    Wine D is Musigny 1999 Comte de Vogue

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 11.8571. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1054
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is  -0.3253. At the
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of
  0.5240 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

                           Pairwise Rank Correlations

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This was an absolutely marvellous tasting. Big news: California wines
  are really good value. With all due respect to Robert Parker, young wines
  can be very enjoyable and reveal nuances of character typically identified
  with mature vintages. Another taster says that he would expect the French
  wines would perform much better in 5 years. The wines seemed to us, with
  the possible exception of the Chambertin, to be ready to drink.  It was
  notable that there were no flawed wines in the group at all. Colors were
  all uniform with one or two exceptions: the Selyem was a little lighter,
  the Kistler Catherine a little darker. However, there was no obvious
  connection to quality.

  This was a very strong test, thanks to our host, of how well the young
  California pinot noir producers are doing relative to the very best French
  producers. California has very much established its credibility. The
  correlation with the price was -0.33, which was to be expected, since the
  French wines were by far the most expensive ones but did not do very well
  in the overall rankings: the three best wines were American and the two worst
  were French.
