 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0692
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.7941. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine F is Ch. Grand Ormeau

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  3.8750. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.7941

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  We are probably the only group that could be drinking Ch. Grand Ormeau 24 years   
  after the vintage. The wines very remarkably similar, which is attested by the  
  very low Kendall W coefficient in the tasting. None of the wines were bad 
  or oxidized and were drinking very well. But it is noteworthy that in     
  spite of Grand Ormeau being the highest ranked wine, none of them      
  was statistically significantly good. 1982, a warm vintage, was often said
  to have wines that would not last very long. Despite that, all of these wine
  still retain fruit and were very pleasant to drink.                      
                                                                            
  The Merlot Hypothesis: Although this is a limited sample, it is interesting
  to note that the Merlot won the tasting, indicating that Merlots may age     
  better than the popular conception.                                   
                                                                            
  Parker came out strongly for 82s and 24 years later his judgment has      
  been vindicated.
