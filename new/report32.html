 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1482
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.3132. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine F is Chambertin Leroy 1990             
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine E is Clos de la Roche Leroy 1990

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  5.9286. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.3132

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Fact 1: The tasting initially was meant to compare 8 wines, two of which  
  were 1959 Leroy grand crus. After beginning the tasting, several people   
  agreed that the 1959s were obviously different from the 1990s. So, it     
  seemed much more sensible to create two flights of wines. All but one     
  person preferred the 1959s to the 1990s.                                  
  Fact 2: The wines of both vintages were of extraordinary high quality,    
  every one in excellent condition.                                         
  The Romanee St. Vivant was the weakest wine of the tasting, and it is     
  generally regarded as the weaker of the Leroy wines in this vintage.      
  However, Robert Parker still rates this wine 96 points, and nobody dis-   
  agrees that this wine is of high quality. The groups consensus favorites  
  of the 1990 vintage, Chambertin Leroy and Clos de la Roche Leroy, were    
  also the wines as ranked as perfect 100 by Parker.                        
  One taster remarks that the common wisdom to the effect that Burgundys    
  are victimized by excessive yields and diminished extract, are defined    
  by these extraordinary wines in their richness and multi-dimensional      
  complexity.

<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2500
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1573. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.
<br>
 The correlation I measures the degree to which the identification of each 
 judge is correlated with the truth. Here a 1.0 means that the judge identified
 the wines perfectly, and a 0 means that he identified none of them.

<br>
<br>
 Next, we show the correlation among the wine identifications of the judges,
 which also ranges between 1.0 and 0.0:
<br>
     C = 0.5625
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small: < 5 %. Most people would say that unless this probability
 is less than 0.1, the judges' identifications are not highly related.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine A is Richebourg Leroy 1959             
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine B is Musigny Leroy 1959                

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  2.0000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1573

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  1.00 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The 1959s belie the conventional wisdom that Burgundies do not age well.  
  The 1990s by contrast, were very drinkable now. Some of us were surprised 
  that the 1959s were as good as they were over 40 years of the original    
  vintage.
