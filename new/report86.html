     ( 6 is the best possible,  30 is the worst)

<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2167
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2674. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   tied for  1st place    Wine C is Cariblanco Kingston (Chile)       
  2.   tied for  1st place    Wine B is Sancerre Chatelain (France)       
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine E is Omaka Springs (New Zealand)       
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine D is Nei Ellis (South Africa)          
---------------------------------------------------
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine A is Groth Sauvignon Blanc (US)        

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  5.2000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.2674

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.90 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

   The participants were aged 24 to 38 and mostly chardonnay drinkers by habit. The wines are from 
   California, Chile, France, South Africa and New Zealand. All cost between $14.50 and $16.50 per 
   bottle. While the tasting was not strictly blind, it might as well have been. The participants knew 
   nothing about the wines reputations nor do they have any discernable regional biases. 

   The Chilean wine got three 1st place votes and a 2nd. But also got a 4th and a 5th. Critics thought 
   they tasted some effervescence. Proponents thought its freshness and crispness was outstanding and 
   outweighed any other considerations. The Groth was considered awful by all but one judge. The consensus 
   was that Groth should get out of the S.B. business before it harms their reputation generally.
   The Sancerre was the most consistent of the high ranking wines. No one really hated it and it is widely 
   available in wine shops. I told the tasters afterwards that New Zealand had made a big bet in the wine 
   world on the success of its Sauvignon Blancs.  No one was impressed based on the Omaka Springs selection.

   Finally, one judge (Chris) is a complete outlier. His correlation with the average ranking of the group 
   may be the lowest ever recorded.
