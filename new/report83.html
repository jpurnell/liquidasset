 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.4519
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0042. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine F is Mondavi 1966                      
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine G is Sebastiani no vintage             
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine E is Martini 1963                      
  4.   tied for  4th place    Wine B is Almaden 1968                      
  5.   tied for  4th place    Wine C is Martini 1962 Zinfandel                      
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine D is Martini 1965

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 18.9796. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0042

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  We had to open a lot of bottles to end up with seven that were not        
  oxidized. The oxidized wines were Buena Vista Haraszty Cellars 1964 (2    
  bottles), Brookside Cabernet, Beaulieu Vineyard George dela Tour          
  Private Reserve 1964, Souverain cabernet sauvignon 1966, Inglenook 1966.  
  Wines from better cellars might have been in better condition. 
  The oxidized  wines may provide some information concerning the chances 
  that the wines have survived intact.
                                                             
  Here we have a Mondavi wine, and a Krug wine, which is the original       
  Mondavi family winery. We also have 3 Martini wines, none of which        
  was oxidized, and a wine from Almaden made when          
  Martin Ray was the winemaker.
                                               
  The Mondavi 1966 cabernet may be the most overwhelming consensus choice   
  of this group since its inception. We found the wine remarkably          
  young and more vibrant than its competitors. In contrast, the Krug 66,    
  which was out lowest rated wine, tasted of cooked prunes.
