 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.5781
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0010. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine A is Ch. Leoville Las Cases 1964       
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine E is Ch. Palmer 1961                   
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine C is Ch. Ausone 1962                   
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine D is Ch. Latour 1962

  5.   ........  5th place    Wine B is Ch. Latour 1961                   

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 18.5000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0010
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is   0.0000. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.8000 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.90 for significance at the 0.1 level

COMMENT:

  Despite the claim that these are ancient wines, it is a tragedy that      
  people do not keep wines as long as our host has kept these. One of the   
  most pleasant tastings we have ever had, apart from the 1961 Latour, which
  was clearly a flawed (but neither oxidized nor corked) wine, the wines   
  are terrific drinking right now and were worth every penny they cost. Our rank- 
  ing of the wines was probably the most highly agreed upon in our history. 
  If you own some 1964 Leoville Las Cases, our top rated wine, you should   
  thank god and your good fortune. Several tasters agree that the Leoville Las Cases      
  outranks several first growths. Several of us believe that Leoville Las Cases      
  is the leading candidate for promotion to first growth status. Since      
  Ch. Gruaud Larose has been another contender for exalted status in our    
  tastings, we plan to organize a taste-off between Leoville Las Cases     
  and Gruaud Larose.
