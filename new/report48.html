 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1432
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2717. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is 1955 Taylor

  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine C is 1948 Graham                       
  3.   tied for  3rd place    Wine A is 1927 Croft                        
  4.   tied for  3rd place    Wine B is 1975 Cockburn

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  5.1556. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.2717

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.90 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  There was no oxidized wine in the group and  they were all decanted       
  competently. We had unusual accompanying food, which was perfect com-    
  plement to the wines. The food included Stilton, of course, and various      
  dried fruits stuffed or wrapped with prosciutto. The 1955 Taylor had      
  a rasberry flavor according to one taster. Another taster said that it    
  is a great and classic port, rich but nuanced, very focused with a long   
  finish. The group does not show significant agreement, but one wine       
  scored significantly well (the 1995 Taylor). The 1927 Croft was a         
  surprise and was in remarkably good condition and that the premier houses 
  (Taylor and Graham) showed better than the second tier houses. The 1975   
  Cockburn had a distinctive color, considerably lighter than the other four
  but not a lighter taste.
