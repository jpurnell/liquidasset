 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1429
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.3326. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  8.0000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.3326

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  When these wines first came out, they were highly touted and claimed to be
  one of the great vintages of the century.  We should note that the 1970s  
  were a very cool decade with many vintages that are completely forgotten, 
  justifiably so. Within this context, this was seen as a must-buy vintage. 
  But this vintage may now be finally living up to its early reputation.    
  The tannins in this vintage have finally softened, but at an age of 33    
  years these wines have no orange tint, which was an early concern with    
  many wines of this vintage. It should be noted that all the wines tasted  
  had been kept in impeccable temperature conditions.
