 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1548
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2775. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  8.6667. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.2775

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  We opened 10 bottles from the 1960's and found 8 that were in good        
  condition. The two bottles that we discarded had very poor ullage.       
  The good bottles, however, were all ullaged to upper-mid shoulder, which  
  suggests that for wines from the 1960's that is the normal ullage level   
  for age. The corks were all in good shape except for the Margaux which was
  crumbling.                                                                
  The wines were in superb condition and generally delicious. There were    
  distinct differences among them. Virtually all the wines have their       
  supporters.                                                               
  The wines were immediately approachable but within 15 minutes began to    
  change and in some cases were quite fragile. This points to the need to   
  serve all the wines immediately from the bottle and enjoy them without   
  decanting.                                                                
  It is unfortunate that we only get to taste wines like this in the setting of a formal   
  wine-tasting. It would be virtually impossible to have these wines with a 
  dinner. We were particularly fortunate to have been able to sample two vintages of Ch. 
  Ausone, which were ranked 1st and 3rd respectively. Note also that among the three 
  vintages the underrated 1964 vintage held its own.
