1983 Bordeaux viewed in 2003
Orley Ashenfelter

The occasion of this tasting through a number of the 1983 red Bordeaux wines seems a 
good time to reminisce.  After all, the wines are now 20 years old and many of us bought 
them 15 or more years ago, and some of us still have them in the cellar.  And having 
tasted through a few of these wines in the last month with at least one member of this 
group, made me think it was worth sharing what we found out.

The Weather and the Wines:  As some people perhaps know, the quality of a Bordeaux 
vintage is a result of the quality and character of the grapes, and these are a result of the 
weather during the growing season.  1983, by the standards of the times, was a very 
warm growing season, much like 1982.  Oddly, in the context of the subsequent two 
decades, 1983 would be considered warm, but not especially warm—in the context of the 
previous two decades it would have been considered extremely warm, the warmest since 
1959.  Is this global warming?  I don't know, but if so, it is surely a good thing for red 
Bordeaux wines—at least until we hit something catastrophic.

Rainfall at harvest was also much like 1982 and, in short, the wines should not be much 
different from the 82s.  I think many people who taste the wines might agree with this, 
although, as always the wines vary somewhat from chateaux to chateaux.  (If you do not 
remember these facts, dig out your old issues of Liquid Assets!)  The market certainly 
does not agree with this assessment, but more about that below.

1983s then, are good wines, like the 1988s, but riper, perhaps less concentrated.  They are 
much riper than the 1985s, but somewhat less concentrated.  It is interesting to compare a 
1983 and 1985 from the same chateaux, which I have not done as often as I wish—I 
usually always prefer the ripe (some might say California!) character of the 1983s, but I 
know many people who I admire greatly (like the Indiana wine collector William Dick, 
and the famous auctioneer Michael Broadbent) who would always take the 1985. To each 
his own!  The 1983s are not up to the standard of 1989 or 1990, but none of the vintages 
prior to 1989 (apart from 1961) are either.

Tasting the Wines Today:  I think most of these wines are now ready to drink; a few may 
be too old, depending on your preferences.  Having tasted Haut Brion several times in the 
last month, I can say, for me, this wine is now terrific—just what you wish you consumed 
in a 3-star restaurant, and our German wine friend, Karl Storchmann, thought it just about 
all you could ask for in a red wine, that is, nearly perfect.  Lesser wines, like Grand Puy 
Lacoste are lighter, but great drinking.  Wines like Lanessan, a simple wine meant to last, 
are also excellent.  A few wines, to my mind, have odd characters—La Lagune seemed, 
recently, to have an odd nose, not what I expected.  And Le Gay is tough and lacks the 
soft character that many would prefer in mature red Bordeaux—though these wines 
certainly have their places, often near a grill!

The Market:  It has always been annoying for younger wine buyers to hear stories about 
what buyers from older cohorts paid for their wines (I was myself one of these younger 
buyers, so I know how they feel!), but I think this is worth discussing because of current 
Bordeaux pricing. Frankly, the prices of red Bordeaux wines are so high that I fear that 
the vast majority of younger buyers can no longer regularly afford to taste through their 
wines and learn about them the old fashioned way.  Most of us purchased wines like the 
1983 Haut Brion for about $35 per bottle—Grand Puy Lacoste was about $10, and wines 
like Meyney were about $8.  These prices no doubt seem shocking by today's standards, 
especially when young wines from the 2002 vintage, certainly not destined to go down in 
any record books in view of the rain at harvest, cost perhaps 4 or 5 times more.  Of 
course, the 1983s were not good investments compared to the stock market—making the 
2002s seem even more absurd to an investor today.

The interesting thing about the 1983s is that they are really wines for drinking—at current 
auction prices they are terrific buys.  The problem?  Hardly any are for sale!  You can 
buy all the 1982s you want at 3 times the prices of the 1983s, and as many of the 
California cults as you want, at even higher prices—but 1983s, they are hard to find!  I 
think most of us who own and drink these wines know what is happening—most of us 
bought 1982s and 1983s.  We sell our 1982s, indeed virtually all the mature wine on offer 
at the auctions is from this vintage, and we drink our 1983s! 

My Advice:  The only vintage like 1983 that I know of today for current buyers to 
consider is 1997:  fine wines, the 1997s are being drunk too soon, and they are selling at 
ridiculously low prices, although they seem to be becoming increasingly difficult to find.  
The 1997s need to be kept—let's just hope we are around to taste them in 2017!
