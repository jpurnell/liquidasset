Despite what many people think, the constitutional amendment that 
prohibited the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages in the United 
States was not repealed; instead it was modified by a new Amendment.  
The new Amendment provided the right to the States to regulate the 
manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages.  Since it was clearly 
intended that the States could bar the manufacture and sale of 
alchoholic beverages, this Amendment has been used to regulate the 
interstate sale of alcoholic beverages--which otherwise would not be 
possible because of the "Interstate Commerce" clause of the U.S. 
Constitution.</p>
