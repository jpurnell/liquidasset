 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2375
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1272. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is Heitz Bella Oaks 1987             
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   tied for  2nd place    Wine A is Heitz Bella Oaks 1986             
  3.   tied for  2nd place    Wine C is Heitz Bella Oaks 1984

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  5.7000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1272

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  1.00 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The host of this tasting bought the four magnums of Heitz Bella Oaks (1984, 
  1985, 1986, 1987) at the winery while paying a visit to Joe and Alice Heitz
  in the early 1990s. Heitz had made the cabernet from Belle and Barney Rhodes 
  vineyard since the 1977 vintage. The vineyard is named for the road that it is
  on, not for Ms. Rhodes, though it is natural to think that they have a mutual
  attraction! Heitz makes no secret of how much wine he makes from this vineyard,
  and each bottle carried a serial number as well as a statement aout the amount 
  of wine produced in that vintage.
  
  Sandwiched between 1983 and 1988, many of the critics have called these the four 
  wonder vintages. However, there have been many partisans of each vintage, and 
  there are also many who do not believe that the vintages are of equal quality 
  today. The 1984 vintage was the ripest, and it is interesting that only a single 
  taster selected this wine as a favorite. In retrospect, the host's own experience 
  with the 1983s from Napa suggested that these wines were terribly under-rated. 
  Also, the 1985 coming out last would be unusual by comparison with popular ratings. 
  
  All of us thought that all of these wines were in perfect condition. They were     
  served from magnums, bought at the winery in 1993 and stored in one cellar. Most   
  tsters had difficulty telling the wines apart, as evidenced by the scores, in part.  
  The order of magnitude of production of regular bottles (as stated on the bottle) 
  ranged from 5,000 to 2,500 cases, from 1986 to 1987; however, the production of       
  magnums remained constant at 200 cases across he four years tasted.      
                                                                            
  Thanks to them being in magnumms, all the wines  were youthful and a pleasure to     
  drink. This just confirms that we need to drink more magnums, particularly because 
  magnums suggest a celebration and we need more of    
  those, and moreover, the wine is better.
