 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.5915
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0001. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 28.3929. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0001

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  It was a wonderful tasting and the overall quality of the wines was superb
  The wines were totally ready. One wine, wine E, which was a CdP by Paul   
  Jeune, was oxidized, suggesting that some of these wines should be drunk  
  very soon. The most interesting finding is the Gigondas, being ranked     
  number 1 and in excellent shape, while it is undoubtedly the least or next
  to least expensive. Keep your eye out for 1989 Gigondas by Daniel         
  Brusset. Query: Was the Beaucastel comparatively youthful and not yet     
  at its prime? The preference for Gigondas may however be just a           
  preference for tastes. Almost certainly, these wines are now ready to     
  drink and there is no reason to not drink them, with the exception of the 
  Beaucastel.
