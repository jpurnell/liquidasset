 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1250
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.6093. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine C is Gevrey Chambertin (Mortet), 1997  
  2.   tied for  2nd place    Wine A is La Tache (DRC) 1997               
  3.   tied for  2nd place    Wine E is Clos de Vougeot (Hudelot Noellat) 
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine D is Musigny (de Vogue) 1997           
  5.   tied for  5th place    Wine F is Volnay Vendange Selectiones (Lafar
  6.   tied for  5th place    Wine G is Gevrey Chambertin 1er cru (Roussea

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  4.5000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.6093

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The lack of agreement in this tasting reflected the extraordinary        
  quality of the wines. The very best of them exhibited an appreciable      
  amount of spice. According to one view, the tasting shows the importance of        
  going with the growers across vintages. Another view was that the growers really       
  do not matter that much because, for example, the estates with the most      
  stellar reputation did not dominate the tasting. As a vintage, 1997 is   
  a good value because it suffers from guilt by association with 1997       
  Bordeaux. However, whatever irrespective of what was said before, within this      
  group it was hardly possible to distinguish among the growers.
