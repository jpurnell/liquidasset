 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3017
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0485. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   tied for  1st place    Wine D is Ch. du Pape, Cailloux, 1998       
  2.   tied for  1st place    Wine C is Ch. du Pape, Le Vieux Donjon, 1998
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine B is Ch. du Pape, Pegau, 1998          
  4.   tied for  4th place    Wine A is Ch. du Pape, Marcoux, 1998        
  5.   tied for  4th place    Wine E is Ch. du Pape, Beaucastel, 1998     
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine F is Ch. du Pape, Usseglio, 1998

  7.   ........  7th place    Wine G is Ch. du Pape, Beaurenard, 1998     

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 12.6735. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0485
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is  -0.3945. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.5710 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The standard of overall winemaking quality was very high.                 
  All the wines are very easy to drink now. It was absolutely widely agreed 
  that one wine did not perform at the same level of quality of the others--
  the Chateau Beaurenard 1998. These are warm wines with a sun-baked        
  Mediterranean character with high alcohol. They are very food-friendly.   
  There was a very high correlation within the group, but it should be noted
  that this was essentially driven by the almost total unanimity on the     
  quality of wine G (Beaurenard). Omitting wine G, our rankings would have  
  been essentially random.
