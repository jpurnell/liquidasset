 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.6122
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0001. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine C is Taittinger 1985 Comptes de Champagne
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine F is Dom Perignon 1985                 
---------------------------------------------------
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine B is Mo&euml;t et Chandon (NV)              
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine E is Cristal 1988                      
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine A is Gruet (NV)                        
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine G is Giulio Ferrari 1980 Riserva

  7.   ........  7th place    Wine D is Uanahcloke Ykpaihu (NV)           
  8.   ........  8th place    Wine H is Great Western (NV)                

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 30.0000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0001

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This was a tasting of wines made in the methode champenoise --- I will    
  not call them champagnes because only those wines made in the Champagne   
  region of France may be called that. There is a real problem after so     
  many years of identifying the wine the name of which we recorded as       
  Uanahcloke Ykraihu. We always remembered it as a "Russian champagne," yet 
  the word Ykraihu looks suspiciously like Ykraiha, which would be the      
  Latin transliteration of the Cyrillic word for Ukraine. In any event,     
  the wine is from the Soviet Union.                                        
                                                                            
  The results show the most fantastic agreement recorded by the tasters    
  ever; two wines are rock bottom (Great Western and this Soviet wine) and  
  two are significantly good. Not surprisingly, the Taittinger and the Dom Perignon
  are the two top champagnes in this tasting.
