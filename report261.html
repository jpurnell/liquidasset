<div class=body>Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):<br><br>    W = 0.2210<br><br>The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation is quite small, 0.0889. Most analysts would say that since this probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences appear to be strongly related.<br><br>We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group preference.<br>A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a perfect predictor of the group's preferences.<br>A 0.0 means no correlation, while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group. This is measured by the correlation R.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering. The Friedman Chi-Square value is 12.375. The probability that this could happen by chance is  0.089.</div>
<div class=body>We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correlations that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.<br><br></div>
<div class=body>Pairwise Rank Correlations<br><br>Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.705 for significance at the 0.05 level, and must exceed  0.626 for significance at the 0.10 level.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>COMMENT:<br><br>Overall this was a marvelous concept, tasting wines from around the world, including tariffs and domestic wines from across the US. Despite their very different origins and grape types the selection was uniformly excellent making it difficult to separate the eight wines.<br>There was no clearly identifiable way of differentiating these wines which even though they were from different varieties and different years predominantly illustrating the great winemaking taking place around the world. <br>In terms of the specific challenge the 3  US wines all came in the middle of the pack. The international wines came out on top but also in last place. <br>Of particular mention must be the top wine which was the Canadian Mission Hill OCULUS, beating out the highly rated Chateau Pavie from 2003. Both wines are predominantly Merlot and Cabernet Franc with these blends comprising over 80% of the wine. Well done Canada. Also a special mention should go to the highest scoring US wine from Texas  the Super Texan 2019 from Flat Creek Estate, blends  Sangiovese and Montepulciano while infusing Petite Syrah and Primitivo grapes,<br>Overall this was an illuminating tasting highlight the tremendous quality from wines from around the world. Hopefully tariffs do not prevent US wine lovers from enjoying these wines, especially those made at Mission Hill.</div>
