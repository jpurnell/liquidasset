     ( 6 is the best possible,  42 is the worst)
<br>
<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2520
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1696. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine E is Ch. de Beaucastel 1990            
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   tied for  2nd place    Wine G is Ch. de Beaucastel 1994

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  9.0714. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1696

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  One of the tasters said that none of the wines had a distinctive bouquet. 
  On the other hand, all of them tasted delicious. It is clear that the     
  1990 stood out heads over the other wines by a much more dramatic         
  margin than is usual in our other tastings.                               
  It should be noted that the balance of acidity and fruit makes this an    
  ideal wine for accompanying food. 
  
  For the sake of another opinion, we quote the tasting notes from <a href="http://www.thewinedoctor.com/tastingsprofile/beaucastel.shtml">
The Wine Doctor</a> for the vintage 1990:

&quot;Chateau de Beaucastel Châteauneuf du Pape 1990: Similarly rich colour. 
Intense fruit, rich with aromas of roasted garrigue herbs, with nuances of 
ink and wet stones. A rich and hedonistic wine on entry, with an immediately 
apparent full and velvety texture. Despite its age this big and muscular wine 
still has a wealth of tannins, but with fine acidity and such rich fruit this 
wine will go the distance. Ripe fruits, with some aromatic, almost floral 
notes. A spicy, tannic finish, and some considerable length. This wine is 
still on the way up, and should be superb. 18.5+/20 (August 2001)&quot;

We should add that none of the tasters in the present tasting noticed any trace 
of brettanomyces, of which Ch&acirc;teauneuf du Pape from Beaucastel is often accused.

As a final comment, we note that there have been two other all-Beaucastel tastings, 
namely <a href="report79.html">Report 79</a> and <a href="report54.html">Report 54</a>. Reports 141 and 79 
have only two overlapping vintages, namely 1990 and 1994, and they order them similarly,
i.e., 1990 is better than 1994. Report 141 and 54 overlap in four vintages: 1985, 1989, 1990
and 1994. Of these, Report 141 ranks 1990 first, has 1989 and 1990 tied for second, and
ranks 1985 last. Report 54 has 1989 and 1994 tied for first and also ranks 1985 last. On 
balance there seems to be a fair if not exceptional intertemporal consistency between these
rankings.
