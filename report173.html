 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2313
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0632. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 14.8000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0632

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.70 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.60 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The wines were opened very early, an hour and a half before the tasting   
  and this helped a great deal. This is basically the 20th anniversary of 
  the vintage which has been quite controversial. The trade claimed it as a      
  fantastic Vin de Garde (keeping wine); meanwhile the trade was split
  in its opnion with Mr. Parker due to tannins and rain during the harvest       
  concerning some questions about variability. Parker was cautious, but the <em>Wine Spectator</em>
  said &quot;Remember the extraordinary 1990 red Burgundies that took the wine world by storm? Now 
  the 1993 vintage is about to burst on the international scene with similar fanfare. Hands down, 1993
  is the best red Burgundy year since 1990, and it might even equal the quality of 1988 and 1989,
  two highly rated vintages.&quot;.  The point was that rain had     
  interrupted the picking but earlier it had been a dry growing season. 
  The theory is that the growers did better than the negociants. This was 
  primarily a grower tasting. As it happens the negociant wine (Jadot)      
  performed on a par with the other wines. The 93 vintage comes through as a 
  superior vintage, contradicting the conventional wisdom that Burgundies   
  don't age well. It is interesting to note that the wine that finished last
  was a C&ocirc;te de Beaune.
