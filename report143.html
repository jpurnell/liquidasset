 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1318
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.3923. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine A is Chateau Musar 1979                
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine H is 1998

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  8.4333. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.3923
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is   0.3950. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.4830 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.70 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.60 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  It is a pleasure to drink a vertical from a much less covered region     
  such as Lebanon. (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Musar">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Musar</a> for a 
  detailed description.) 

  And the wines did not disappoint and confirmed many of   
  the groups intermittent exposure to the wine. The style overall is       
  characterized by a rich sweet style that is pleasurable to drink. The    
  wines do obviously very well with bottle age, the 1979 being the oldest  
  and the highest rated and the 1998 is the second highest. The balance and 
  acidity was good in all the wines. The Internet literature suggests that  
  the 1987 (our rank 3) is flawed which we did not find to be so. One      
  taster suggested that the wines are not "sweet," but "rich" and portlike. 
  One taster opined that the 1979 Musar reminded him of a Ducru Beaucaillou.
  What was very interesting is that the 1993 generated a bipolar distribu-  
  tion, with three taster ranked it No. 1 or 2 and three ranked it No. 9. The
  overall agreement in the group was not overwhelming, but even so, the 1996
  showed up as significantly "bad."
