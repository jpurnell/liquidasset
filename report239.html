 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1079
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.6251. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine E is Catena Zapata Mundus Bacillus 2013
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine G is Catena Zapata River Stones 2017   
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine F is Achaval Ferrer Medrano 2005       
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine H is Colome, Salta 2016                
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine B is Catena Zapata Malbec 2018         
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine D is Catena Zapata Fortuna Terrae 2018 
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine C is Salentein Res. Valle de Uco 2006

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  5.2857. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.6251

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This was a very special tasting of Argentinian Malbecs, with 4 of the wines being sourced directly from the 
  Catena Zapata cellars, including the wine that came first, the Mundus Bacillus Terrae, from the high altitude 
  Adrianna Vineyard. The Catena Zapata winery, with it’s great focus on terroir, is generally viewed as producing 
  the finest wines in Argentina.
 
The other four wines were from other outstanding vineyards of Mendoza, with one from Salta (Colomé). Such fine 
bodegas as Salentein and Achaval Ferrer were included, with the latter represented by their well-regarded Finca 
Mirador Malbec. Overall the wines were of uniformly high standards, and there was a low range of difference between 
the high and low scores of individual tasters, when viewed together as a group.
 
All the wines were 100% Malbec and they demonstrated the aging potential of these wines with vintages represented 
between 2003 to 2019, at the same time the young wines were very approachable and delicious.
