 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1440
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.4109. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine E is Ch. Palmer 1997                   
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine B is Ch. Palmer 1998                   
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine F is Ch. La Mission Haut Brion 1996    
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine D is Ch. La Mission Haut Brion 1995    
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine A is Ch. Pichon Longueville 1996       
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine C is Ch. Lafite Rothschild 1995        

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  5.0408. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.4109

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  These wines represented a cross section of the top Bordeaux left bank between the years 95 to 98.
  Ovberall, it demonstrated the very high quality of the top Bordeaux produce.Even more dramatic was the
  performance of the top wine, Palmer 1997, which was seen as one of the poorer vintages in the decade
  by some. The Margaux wines performed very strongly and they outperformed what were seen as stronger vintages.
  
  It reminds us once again that Bordeaux provides great pleasure even in the slightly lesser vintages. These are 
  very drinkable wines, very attractive and can be enjoyed now, at their peak.
  
  After the official wine tasting we had some French pastries such as madelaines, accompanied by two different
  vintages of Alvear Pedro Ximenez, which were astonishingly good.
