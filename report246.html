<div class=body>Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):<br><br>    W = 0.2000<br><br>The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation is rather large, 0.2206. Most analysts would say that unless this probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly related.<br><br>We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group preference.<br>A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a perfect predictor of the group's preferences.<br>A 0.0 means no correlation, while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group. This is measured by the correlation R.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering. The Friedman Chi-Square value is  7.000. The probability that this could happen by chance is  0.221.</div>
<div class=body>We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correlations that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.<br><br></div>
<div class=body>Pairwise Rank Correlations<br><br>Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.812 for significance at the 0.05 level, and must exceed  0.740 for significance at the 0.10 level.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>COMMENT:<br>Overall this was a very special tasting with the wines ranging from 25 to 70 years of age, all purchased on release except for the 1952.
The wines were all in good condition with even the 52 showing liveliness.
The tasting results showed no significance between the wines although the wine that was preferred with the lowest votes against was the 1982 that was still showing that it had plenty of life still ahead of it at over 40 years of age.
The 89 and 98 both highly rated wines were separated by a single vote coming 2nd and 3rd.
There is no rush to drink these wines.
The tasting finished with a comparison between the 89 and 90 Dâ€™yquem with the 89 being clearly preferred, showing a long life ahead.
