 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3294
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0238. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine C is Corton Renardes, Girardin, 1998   
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine A is Corton, Bouchard,1999

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 16.1429. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0238

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  If we had had any of these wines at a good restaurant, we would have been    
  pleased , except for wine F. It is interesting to note that the older     
  wines did better than the others, in that the 1993, 1998, and 1999 had    
  average scores of 24, which is much better than the others. In fact, we can 
  perform the appropriate significance test for the null hypothesis that the
  older wines are equal to the younger ones, using the test suggested in 
  Quandt, R. E., "A Note on a Test for the Sum of Ranksums," <em>Journal of Wine
  Economics</em>, May 2007, pp. 98-102. The test statistic in the present case is
  0.6667, whereas the critical value at the 0.05 level is 0.7651; hence the 
  result emphatically rejects the null hypothesis.
  
  It is also interesting to note that the Faiveley wines were the least liked. Despite 
  the fact that this tasting spanned 10 years and 7 producers, it           
  illustrated that there is a Corton style. None of these wines despite     
  their differences deviated from that. There is a question about their     
  design for the long haul.
  
  The interested reader may wish to compare this tasting to another Corton tasting that took 
  place almost one year earlier, which is reported in <a href="report118.html">Report 118</a>.
