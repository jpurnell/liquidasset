<div class=body>Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):<br><br>    W = 0.2119<br><br>The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation is rather large, 0.1680. Most analysts would say that unless this probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly related.<br><br>We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group preference.<br>A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a perfect predictor of the group's preferences.<br>A 0.0 means no correlation, while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group. This is measured by the correlation R.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering. The Friedman Chi-Square value is 10.381. The probability that this could happen by chance is  0.168.</div>
<div class=body>We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correlations that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.<br><br></div>
<div class=body>Pairwise Rank Correlations<br><br>Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.705 for significance at the 0.05 level, and must exceed  0.626 for significance at the 0.10 level.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>COMMENT:<br><br>Overall this was a very interesting and eclectic tasting covering both hemispheres with fine examples from our hosts cellars. <br>Despite the differing styles there was a surprising unanimity in preference for the winner which was a ready to drink 1996 Opus One wine that was drinking well and has many years ahead of it. The youngest wine in the tasting held up well against older wines and its older sister the 1992 did equally well. The older wines once again demonstrated the value of good cellaring.<br>All the wines were in good condition but the Cims de Porrea was felt to be slightly oxidized and thus impacted its rating. <br>This was a lot of fun. <br></div>
