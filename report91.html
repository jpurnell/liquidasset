                        Table of Votes Against                                  
                                                                                
              Wine ->   A   B   C                                               
<br>
     Group Ranking ->   1   3   1
     Votes Against ->   7  10   7
<br>
     ( 4 is the best possible,  12 is the worst)
<br>
<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1875
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.4724. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.
<br>
 The correlation I measures the degree to which the identification of each 
 judge is correlated with the truth. Here a 1.0 means that the judge identified
 the wines perfectly, and a 0 means that he identified none of them.
<br>
       Correlation Between the Ranks of
 Each Person With the Average Ranking of Others
<br>
  Name of Person      Correlation R                                
                                                                                
  Frank                 0.5000                                         
  Amanda                0.5000                                        
  John                  0.5000                                        
  Dick                 -1.0000                                         
                                                                                
                                                                                
<br>
<br>
 Next, we show the correlation among the wine identifications of the judges,
 which also ranges between 1.0 and 0.0:
<br>
     C = 0.2500
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small: < 5 %. Most people would say that unless this probability
 is less than 0.1, the judges' identifications are not highly related.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   tied for  1st place    Wine A is Tokaji Aszu 6 putt. 1993          
  2.   tied for  1st place    Wine C is Tokaji Aszu 5 putt. 1993          
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine B is Tokaji Aszu Essencia 1993        

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  1.5000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.4724

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  1.00 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  All three wines had a dark amber color, with wine C perhaps a shade lighter.
  One taster thought that the Essencia needed some more glass time. This   
  taster almost changed his mind at the time that the votes were cast.     
  Another taster thought that wine C (5 puttonyos) had a bitter aftertaste 
  and that B (the essencia) was the smoothest with a lovely oily texture. The three      
  judges who ranked the essencia last, struggled mightily to tell the      
  difference between A and C. We also tasted a late harvest St. Jean, 1982, riesling 
  (not included in the rankings)and it acquitted itself very well against this competition.
