 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.4628
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0005. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is Ch. Leoville Las Cases 1990
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine A is Ch. Leoville Las Cases 1989
---------------------------------------------------
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine H is Ch. Margaux 1989
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine F is Ch. Ducru Beaucaillou 1979
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine B is Ch. Ducru Beaucaillou 1970
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine E is Ch. Latour 1993
---------------------------------------------------
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine C is Ch. Margaux 1976
  8.   ........  8th place    Wine G is Ch. Latour 1977

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 25.9167. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0005
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is   0.6707. At the
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of
  0.5240 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

                           Pairwise Rank Correlations

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  During the tasting, the judges noted that all the wines were tasting
  wonderful and that it was very difficult to find differences among
  them. In the light of that, it is amazing that there was so much
  agreement among the judges; a concordance that was incredibly
  significant.

  The tasting is a testimonial of the vintage year. The top three rated
  wines from the group were in years 1989 and 1990, years with hot summers
  and little or insignificant autumn rain. The wine that we ranked last was
  from 1977, a year of a a quite cold summer, even tough it was a first
  growth. We were rather amazed at the correlation among the judges, because
  when we were tasting the, we thought that there was going to be no
  correlation among us. Independent of the tasting, Leoville just
  dominated the tasting.
