 We now measure the amount of correlation (W) among the judges:                 
 W = 1.0 => perfect correlation, W = 0 => no correlation                        
<br>
 We also provide a probability measure that this correlation is due to chance   
<br>
 In this case the correlation is =     0.1726                                   
<br>
 Probability that correlation is due to chance = 0.2083                         
<br>
  We compute the correlation of each taster with the average ranking of the oth-
 ers. 1.0 => perfect correlation, 0 => no correl., -1.0 => total disagreement

This tasting spanned a 20-year vintage range from six well&ndash;regarded estates om Chianti Classico. 
With the exception of one of the wines, which was fading, all the other wines were drinking well.
Rarely in the tasting history of our group has one wine separated itself from the others in our
collective preference as did the Isole e Olena 2008. It was also noteworthy that the three
riservas in the collection did not stand out. While no conclusion could be drawn of an optimal
drinking window (six bottles from the 1997&ndash;2008 vintages were essentially undifferentiated), 
the tasting did confirm that Chinati Classico from good producers could be drunk with pleasure for
20 years.
