 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1603
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.3454. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is Opus One 2002                     
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine F is Silver Oak Alexander Vall. 2003   
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine C is Silver Oak Napa 2003

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  7.8571. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.3454

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  At our last tasting of cabernets, including French and California wines,  
  Opus One had the lowest votes against. It is interesting that in this   
  tasting with different California cabernets and including an Australian     
  Grange Hermitage, Opus One also won the tasting, although by not as big a   
  margin. Interestingly also, the Grange was difficult for the group to identify 
  as distinct from the California cabernets and ultimately ranked in   
  the middle of the pack. One taster says that he hates California cabernets;
  wine B is the quintessence of that. But these wines were    
  superb, particularly the Silver Oak Napa.
