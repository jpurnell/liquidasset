 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3365
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0059. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine I is Joseph Phelps Insignia            
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine F is Lewis L Reserve                   
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine B is Paul Hobbs Michael Black Vineyard 
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine A is Stags Leap Cask 23                
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine C is Kendall Jackson Grand Reserve     
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine G is Beringer Private Reserve          
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine H is Beaulieu Vineyard Georges de Latour
---------------------------------------------------
  8.   ........  8th place    Wine D is Chimney Rock

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 21.5333. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0059
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is   0.1833. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.4830 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.70 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.60 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The date that will live in infamy! This tasting represented a cross section 
  of the 1997 vintage. Overall the wines were fresh, enjoyable with fruit  
  and they had a lot of life in them. The alcohol levels of these wines      
  were from 13.3 to 14.5 % alcohol, which appears to be lower than these    
  same vineyards are producing. The winner, wine I, was 13.8% and the     
  loser was  13.3%. The Merlot finished third and shows that merlot         
  has greater longevity than usually expected. Everybody agreed that all the 
  wines in the tasting were of extremely high quality. 
  
  We also computed the Spearman Rho rank correlation between the group's 
  ranking and Robert Parker's ranking. In order to compute this we had to omit
  the one merlot in the group (Stags Leap Cask 23) for which we had no Parker rating.
  The correlation coefficient was 0.205, which is not statistically significant.
