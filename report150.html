 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1793
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2745. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine B is 1982

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  7.5306. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.2745

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  For famous winewriters the '89 and '90 are the top wines but for us 
  the '82 and '79 were the tops. We clearly do not agree with Parker's
  assesments since we ranked the '82 first and the '79 and '85 close     
  together and second. Clearly the older wines were clearly the preferred    
  wines for us.                                                                    
                                                                            
  The wines were all outstanding, with a strong and wonderful bouquet,
  but they evolved in the glass and they were almost indistinguishable
  by the end of the tasting. It should be noted that we are comparing here  
  our tastings with Parker's tastings as of 5 years ago. Also, the wines    
  immediately oversame us with their bouquets, which were powerful and       
  excellent, and their taste was all fantastic.                        
                                                                            
  It is noteworthy that the wines other than the number one ranked wine were 
  all very comparable and all phenomenal.                                       
                                                                            
  It is also reasonable to believe that the 89 and 90 will develop further.
  
  An interesting observation about the sensitivity of the numerical results is 
  the following. If the one person who ranked wine B 6th and wine G first had 
  reversed his rankings between these two wines, the Kendall W coefficient would
  have increased to 0.2959 and the probability that this event could have
  occurred by chance would have changed from O.2745 to 0.0531, which is near statistical
  significance. Hence, statistical significance requires more than just casual agreement.
  
  Reader's of these notes may wish to compare these tastings with another Hermitage La 
  Chappelle tasting that took place in <a href="report40.html">January 2001</a>.
