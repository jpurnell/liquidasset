     ( 5 is the best possible,  30 is the worst)

 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2046
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.4021. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine C is Ch. Palmer 1997                   
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine D is Ch, Margaux  1998                 
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine B is Ch. Latour 1997                   
  4.   tied for  4th place    Wine A is Ch. Cheval Blanc 1997             
  5.   tied for  4th place    Wine E is Ch. Latour 1998                   
---------------------------------------------------
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine F is Ch. Haut Brion 1997               

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  5.1143. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.4021

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The host hasn't tasted any of these wines in about five years and at      
  that time he was not totally pleased with how they btasted. Today, they   
  were much improved and on the whole they did taste like first growths     
  or nearly that. The wines were quite similar and only the Haut Brion      
  stood out as less than adequate. They were all enjoyable and ready to     
  drink.
