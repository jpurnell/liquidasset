 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0714
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.7798. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine F is Pina                              
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine G is St. Eden                          
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine B is Paul Hobbs                        
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine D is Dominus                           
  5.   tied for  5th place    Wine C is Seven & Eight Estate              
  6.   tied for  5th place    Wine H is Ghost Block                       
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine A is D.R. Stephens                     
  8.   ........  8th place    Wine E is Gargiulo                          

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  4.0000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.7798
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is   0.1818. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.5240 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This was a tasting of Napa Cabs. Overall the wines appeared to be in a    
  narrow range despite the differences in the tasting between the age       
  (a range of 10 years) and price. This speaks somewhat to a uniformity    
  of style and approach to wine making.                                    
                                                                            
  The wines and the relative preferences of the tasters do not appear       
  to have any correlation with price. Alcohol levels were in the typical    
  range for modern Napa Cabs  of between 14.1% and 15.0%.                   
                                                                            
  At the end of the tasting we shared a wine that had been made by one      
  of our tasters in Napa. It was the Husic 2007. The feeling of the group   
  was that if this wine had been included in this tasting, it would have    
  performed at the very top if the group.
