 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1283
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.4951. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R. The correlation with price shows the 
 extent to which each judges ranking are correlated with the price of the wine.
 A higher correlation with price indicates that the judge in question preferred the
 more expensive wine.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different. None of the wines is significantly better or worse than
another.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is Numanthia 2001                    
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine A is Lo Givot 2001                     
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine C is Fra Fulco 2001                    
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine F is Vall Llach 2001                   
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine E is Embruix 2001                      
  6.   tied for  6th place    Wine B is Los Mogador 2001                  
  7.   tied for  6th place    Wine G is Mas Doix 2001                     

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  5.3878. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.4951
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is  -0.0545. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.5710 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  We first wish to note that our colleague Frank was absent for this        
  tasting, as was Orley. Some of the wines were much more tannic than       
  others and the differences among the tasters is partly explained by their 
  tolerance for tannic wines. The wines were all extremely good and         
  drinkable and had delicious bouquets. Basically, B, A, and G were not very
  tannic, whereas C, E, F were rather more so. One taster noted that the     
  rankings were essentially random and had nothing to do with the tannic     
  nature of the wines. So, the upshot is that not only did we disagree      
  about the wines, we also disagree about what makes us disagree about the  
  wines. Another taster argued that the bouquets were more variable than    
  other aspects of the wines. All in all, all of these wines are remarkably 
  approachable. Note also that our ranking was substantially negatively correlated
  with the ranking of Parker. The overall correlation among the tasters is one  
  of the lowest in recent memory.
