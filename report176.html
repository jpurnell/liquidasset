<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2716
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0334. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.
<br>
 The correlation I measures the degree to which the identification of each 
 judge is correlated with the truth. Here a 1.0 means that the judge identified
 the wines perfectly, and a 0 means that he identified none of them.

<br>
<br>
 Next, we show the correlation among the wine identifications of the judges,
 which also ranges between 1.0 and 0.0:
<br>
     C = 0.7232
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large: > 10%. Most people would say that unless this probability
 is less than 0.1, the judges' identifications are not highly related.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 15.2083. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0334

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:
 
 This tasting was scheduled to take place on a day on which a significant
 winter storm hit our town (once again!). Three of us have had the habit of 
 never driving to a tasting but sharing a taxi. After several phone calls
 two more people wished to join in our motorized expedition. The taxi that 
 showed up happened to be a Toyota Prius, obviously not designed for a driver
 plus five passengers. There was nothing to be done: e.g., no second taxi 
 could be called since none were available in the ongoing snow storm. So four 
 of us piled in in the normal way, and we stashed the fifth person in the
 luggage compartment---an inspired solution if there ever was one. The car's 
 traction was good until we cam upon a slight hill, on which forward motion 
 ceased. We immediately piled out and pushed and managed to push the taxi over
 the crest of the hill, from which point on it was easy sailing. This obviously 
 worked up a healthy appetite and thirst, the latter being quenched immediately
 with a delicious Chassagne Montrachet.

  The wines were all excellent across the many regions and many vintages, all     
  drinking very well. There was at least one big surprise, and that was the      
  1997 Castel which was an Israeli wine from the Judean Hills (Haute-Judee). 
  Here we have an Israeli wine with considerable bottle age that does     
  very well in the tasting. It was also a big surprise that the Trevaillon  
  did so badly in the ratings. There is a possibility that the results     
  were impacted by a flaw, which is that one of the tasters' wine F, the Ch.     
  Musar, was evidently different from at least two of the wines labeled F   
  in other tasters' glasses. One explanation for this phenomenon is that   
  one of the glasses was not entirely free of residual taint. One taster   
  felt, and many agreed, that although these wines came from many parts    
  of the globe they had a considerable similarity. This suggests that a     
  modern cabernet style will appeal broadly, but as a result this creates a 
  demand for specialized variatals that don't fit under the big global    
  grape umbrella. In any event, the degree of agreement among the tasters
  was very high. The alcohol content ranged from 12.5% (for the Domaine du Castel)
  to 14.5% (for the Meinert and the Trefethen). In each case the Cabernet Sauvignon
  was blended (mostly un unstated proportions) with a subset of Merlot, Petit Verdot,
  Cabernet Franc, Malbec, Cinsault, Carignan and Syrah, with the exception of the
  Meinert which was 100% Cabernet Sauvignon.
