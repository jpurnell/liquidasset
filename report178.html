 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3631
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0049. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 20.3333. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0049

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This tasting represents the inclusion of the very rare cuv&eacute;e       
  Catherine in a tasting of Kistler Pinot Noirs. We wondered how this wine would 
  taste among its peers of multiple vintages. Our conclusion was this    
  is a great wine that is enjoyable back through 1999, 15 years. The       
  hypothesis to be investigated, as stated by our host, was whether Kistler Pinot Noirs age as 
  well as old Burgundies. Out tentative conclusion, having disregarded        
  the data from a flawed bottle and confirmed by a tasting of the same vintage  
  from another bottle was that these wines, while being fabulous,             
  appeared to peak in the 7-9 year window. We had an incredibly generous  
  host who, when faced with a 1999 which was flawed, replaced it with    
  a fresh bottle. In addition, our generous host provided a fresh bottle    
  of the 2009 vintage as well. Thus, we were able to taste the 2009 and     
  the 1999, each from fresh bottles, to assess the effects of age on       
  the wines. The 1999 Kistler replacement was a Sonoma coast versus        
  Russian river, which may or may not be signifcant. Unlike many other      
  tastings, the wines did not change very much in taste or bouquet after    
  they were opened. This tasting was a truly memorable experience.
  
  It is worth mentioning that since April 2004, one or two Kistler Pinot Noirs 
  (for a total of six) in four different tastings (not counting the present one), 
  matched in each case by other American Pinot Noirs and Burgundy Pinot Noirs 
  (in one tasting a New Zealand Pinot was also included). The six Kistlers ranked
  in their respective tastings first in three tastings (once tied for first place),
  second once, and fifth twice, a remarkable overall record.
  
  The Kendall W coefficient is 0.3631, and the probability that this could have 
  occurred by chance is a mere 0.0049, a highly significant result. Since there
  was almost complete agreement that wine E was flawed, one may wonder to what extent
  overall result is driven by the agreement on wine E. To account for that, we reranked
  the results as if wine E had not existed at all. Note that we are not proposing to
  make fiduciary statements about the results of this reranking, since using (part of)
  the data for such an exercise would not be valid; accordingly we are solely interested
  inthe mechanical alteration of the results. The upshot of this exercise is that the W
  coefficient declines to 0.1440 and the probability that this could have occurred by
  chance increases to 0.3292, from which we would have inferred that no significant agreement
  existed.
