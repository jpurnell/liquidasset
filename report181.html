 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0802
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.7432. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  5.1333. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.7432

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.70 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.60 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This is one of the few times the group has ever tasted L&eacute;oville Barton, the last
  occasion having been almost ten years ago. In pasticular, in 2005 we tasted a 1982, in 2003 
  also a 1982, and in 1999 we tasted the 1990 L&eacute;oville Barton, the only previous tasting
  in which we tasted a wine present in today's tasting. On each of the previous occasions the 
  L&eacute;oville Barton ranked either 7th or 8th in a very strong field of competitors.
  
  In honor of this occasion, and in honor of L&eacute;oville Barton, one of our members 
  has composed a poem:      
       
  Because much of it has been shipped to the UK,                        
  There was a limey named Martin                                            
  Who did not have a toilet to fart in,                                     
  Too poor to buy food                                                       
  He lived in the tube,                                                     
  And drank nothing but L&eacute;oville Barton.
  
  
                                      
  L.B. has gained a reputation over 30 years for quality and reasonable
  value. Over this 30 year span there has been great consistency in the quality
  of these wines. This tasting bears out this conclusion. This wine will drink
  well for at least 30 years and perhaps longer. In spite of the considerable time 
  span covered by this tasting, the wines were very similar, which is attested by the 
  very low Kendall W coefficient of concordance.
  
  One may wish to test the hypothesis that, on the whole, the younger wines were
  preferred to the older ones. Since there is an odd number of wines, a prior 
  decision is needed concerning whether the middle year, 1995, is counted as &quot;older&quot; or
  &quot;younger.&quot; No significant difference is found either way, although if 1995 is  treated 
  as younger, the result is almost significnt at the 0.05 level.
