 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2762
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0507. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 15.4667. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0507

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.70 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.60 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  We thought it would be interesting to have a tasting of wines from three
  adjacent vineyards in Burgundy for three matched years. So, what we have 
  is Bonnes Mares, Clos de Tart and Clos des Lambreys for 1999, 2002 and 2003.
  
  Clos de Tart is a single owner vineyard, hence it is designated as "Monopole."
  Clos des Lambreys is almost single owner, but just misses because a small portion
  is owned by Domaine Taupenot-Merme. Bonnes Mares had many owners. Clos de Tart 
  and Clos des Lambreys are in the commune of Morey Saint Denis; Bonnes Mares
  is situated mostly in Chambolle Musigny, with a small part in Morey Saint Denis.
  It would have been nice if all three bottles of Bonnes Mares had come from a
  single owner, but that was beyond the host's powers. The actual Bonnes Mares were
  Laurent (1999), Moine Hudelot (2002) and Bouchard (2003).
  
  We anticipated that all wines would be good, and that was indeed the case. One
  person remarked that, taken alone, each of these wines would be quite fantastic.In
  spite of that there was a surprising amount of agreement in the group, with the 
  probability that the degree of agreement could have arisen by chance only a hair over 5%.
  An interesting point to note is that the disagreement among the tasters was worst for the 
  2002 Clos de Tart, which was ranked first by two tasters and worst or next to worst by
  four. Also interesting is the fact that the very best wine is by a negociant (Bouchard). 
  We were surprised by how badly Clos de Tart did agaist the other wines and performing
  the significance test that it is worse than the other six wines yields a test
  statistic of 1.29, marginally significant at the 0.05 level. Testing the hypothesis that
  2003 is significantly better than the aggregate of the other wines (being mindful of 
  the fact that these two tests cannot be performed validly on the same set of data) yields
  a test statistic of 1.37, which is highly significant. The wines aged beautifully and we
  surmised that they can be aged for 25 years without bad results. Given the stylistic and 
  differences, it is hard to draw distinctions among them.
