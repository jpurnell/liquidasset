 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2083
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1121. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 11.6667. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1121

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The provenance of the wines was as follows: B, E and F were French, 
  C, G and H were from California, A ws from Oregon and D was from New Zealand.
  
  The tasters' top four ranked wines were new world selections.   
  The Burgundies were the three oldest wines tasted and not from            
  the most distinguished vintages. There was clearly a stylistic preference 
  for different winemaking styles. The New Zealand wine seemed to bridge   
  the sweeter American wines and the drier French wines. All the    
  wines were drinking very well. Comparing the sum of the rank sums for the three
  French wines with the corresponding sum of the non-French wines yields a test statistic
  of 1.352, indicating that the non-French wines were significantly preferred to 
  the French ones. (See Quandt, R. E., &quot;A Note on a Test for the Sum of Ranksums,&quot;
  <em>Journal of Wine Economics</em>, Vol. 2, No. 1, 2007, pp. 98-112.) It is also worth noting 
  that the agreement in the group was not very strong, yielding a Kendall W of 0.2083, and the
  dispersion among the tasters is indicated by the fact that there were three wines each
  of which received one or more first place votes as well as one or more last place votes.
