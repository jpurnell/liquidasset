 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1176
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.5678. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   tied for  1st place    Wine D is Volnay, Ampeau, Les Santenots 1er cru 1999  
  2.   tied for  1st place    Wine H is Vosne Roman&eacute;e, Engel, Les Brul&eacute;es 1er cru 2001

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  5.7619. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.5678

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:
</pre><p>
  This was a most interesting tasting of wines from the C&ocirc;te d'Or, with most wines from the C&ocirc;te de Nuit and a few from
  the C&ocirc;te de Beaune, from excellent years, including the fabulous 1999s. These are excellently performing
  vintages across the board. They all had natural Burgundian acidity and the results reflect the personal stylistic
  preferences of the tasters rather than the qualities of the wines. The Chambolle Musigny finished on a comparable
  level with the grands crus, which is interesting. In our opinion, the Chambolle Musigny is a real star in the Burgundy
  family, particularly because it is so much less expensive than the Musigny itself; to wit, the Musigny of the Comte de Vog&uuml;&eacute;.
  Note also that, with the exception of the grand creu, the prices of the wines were all rather comparable.
  </p><p>
  There was essentially no agreement in the group, which is indicated not only by the low value of the Kendall W coefficient, but also 
  by  the fact that many of the wines were tied with each other in terms of the rank sums. Nor is there any discernible pattern in
  the vintages: for example, a 1999 achieved first place (tied) but also managed to get a last place (also tied).
