 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1349
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.3742. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine G is 1997

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  8.6333. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.3742

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.70 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.60 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  
  Heitz Martha's is an iconic Napa wine and is arguanly the first single vineyard
  wine in the U.S., first produced in 1996. It was one of the Judgment of Paris wines 
  and has produced many outstanding wines since.What is somewhat unusual about this 
  wine is that the wine is 100% Cabernet, vinified in an identical way, +/- one or 2 months
  in a mixture of American and French oak. That may account for the similarity in style
  of these wines which had been produced over a period of 20 years.
  
  The only other point of note is that both the 1985 and 2005, both famous vintages, had a
  slightly musty hint which made them less representative of the cvintages.
  
  Demonstrating the compelling power of terroir over vintage or winemaking, they were all 
  distinguished wines with real but subtle differences.          
  In contrast to earlier tastings, these wines were remarkably similar      
  despite a 20-year span of vintages. The reputation of the older vintages 
  was not vindicated by the tasters' assessments.
