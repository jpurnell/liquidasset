 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2469
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0953. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   tied for  1st place    Wine C is Marimar 1995

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  7.9000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0953

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.90 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  All the wines we taste today come from the Russian River Valley in Sonoma, California, and are from
 the Marimar Estate.  The proprietor and founder, Marimar Torres, has made wines in Sonoma for several 
 decades, and today we taste some examples of chardonnay (2008 and perhaps 2000) and pinot noir with bottle 
 age (1993-1997)  The Estate is located north of Sebastopol in Green Valley (the wines are entitled to 
 this appellation, as well as the Russian River and Sonoma Coast appellations).  Marimar is one of the 
 first in what is now a distinguished group of women making wines in California.  Many of the Marimar 
 Estate staff are women also—and with any luck Marimar’s daughter, Cristina (Princeton ’05), will continue 
 that tradition.
 
 These 25 year old wines were all excellent, and an extremely pleasant surprise. The only pinot noir wines 
 expected to age so well, it was suggested by one person, are those from the DRC. Indeed, one person 
 suggested it would be fascinating to compare them in a blind tasting. It was noted that it was a strictly
 European style wine with low yields and greater concentration of flavors. There was a fairly surprising degree of
 agreement within the group. But the two wines that were least liked were the two oldest.
