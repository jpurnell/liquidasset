 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2125
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1307. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  8.5000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1307

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

 <p>This was a vertical tasting wines made by one of the winemakers with the
longest track record in Napa:  Ric Forman.  The wines we tasted were
from the Forman winery and included all the Forman  cabernets between
1983 and 1988.  Forman began his career at Sterling, and his cabernets
made there during the period 1970 to 1980 are extraordinarily fine wines
that have withstood the test of time better than virtually all the other
wines made in this period.  Forman left Sterling around 1980, worked at
Newton for a short time, and then began making wines under his epynomous
label.  In the main tasting we sample most of the Forman cabernets from
the 1980s.  As usual, the wines were tasted blind and in random order,
although everyone was aware that these were Forman cabernets.</p>
<p>
 At the end of the tasting, we also opened a 1975 Sterling Reserve         
 Cabernet and we will comment on that in due course, because it was also   
 made by Ric Forman. This Sterling Reserve is a highly extracted well-     
 balanced wine with more complex nose and flavors than any of the 1980's   
 Formans we tasted. The two things that stand out in the main tasting are     
 the incredible consistency of the wines and the fact that we ranked       
 the 1988 (considered a weak vintage) so highly. One member of the group   
 thought that the Sterling needed to be drunk very soon after opening,     
 because it faded fast. Another taster thought that the wines were         
 initially unapproachable but that with time they became increasingly      
 pleasant to drink.</p>
