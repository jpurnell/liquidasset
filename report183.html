 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2135
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1019. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is Silver Oak (Napa) 2007            
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine G is Opus One 2010                     
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine F is Igneous Cabernet 2004             
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine C is Shafer One Point Five 2009        
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine A is Shafer Hillside Select 2008       
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine H is Pride Mountain 2007               
---------------------------------------------------
  7.   tied for  7th place    Wine E is Phelps Insignia 2005              
  8.   tied for  7th place    Wine B is Dominus 2006                      

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 11.9583. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1019
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is  -0.2036. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.5240 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Everybody agreed that these were fantastic wines. The alcohol in these     
  wines ranges from 13.9% for Silver Oak to 15.5% for Shafer Hillside       
  Select. All wines with the exception of the Silver Oak were over 14%.     
  The group's correlation with price was negative on the whole, meaning  
  that the higher priced wines were liked less, with the exception of      
  Opus One. Historically, Opus One has performed at a high level during    
  our tastings,as in this case, where it placed No. 2. It should be noted   
  that these wines are designed with an immediate appeal and initially    
  they were very hard to tell apart. It may be interesting in five years'    
  time to see how the two worst performing wines yet reputationally         
  longer aging wines would fare.
