 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3187
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0372. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine E is Poetry 2001                       
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine D is Heitz 2001                        
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine B is Cardinale 2002                    
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine A is Grace 2002

  5.   ........  5th place    Wine C is Rudd 2002                         

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 10.2000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0372
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is  -1.0000. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.8000 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.90 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  All the wines were quite amazing. They had a substantially similar        
  bouquet but did not taste identical by any means. Nevertheless, the       
  tasters claimed that they had difficulty in distinguishing among the      
  wines. On the whole, the Poetry was deemed to be significantly good and   
  the Rudd was thought to be significantly bad. One taster judged the        
  wine that was second worst in the aggregate as being first. The real      
  question was whether the tasters could differentiate among the very       
  expensive wines (ranging from $105 to $159) and the relatively inexpensive
  Heitz costing only $45. In fact, the Heitz was the second highest ranked wine,
  which suggests that the higher priced wines are substantially overpriced.
  The tasters were asked to identify the Heitz in a 
  secret ballot, and only one out of eight tasters succeded in identifying  
  this wine. Every taster's preferences among the wines was negative        
  correlated with the wine prices except for the one contrarian taster who  
  ranked the Grace first. 
  
  It is worth mentioning that this is a lanmdmark tasting in that it is the 
  100th tasting since we have started to record the tastings and the statistical 
  results in a systematic way. The only noteworthy observation we can make is that
  a statistical analysis of the results of the tastings suggests on the basis of the 
  Kendall W-coefficients (or rather, of the p-values corresponding to these coefficients)                                                 
  that we have not increased over time the degree of agreement among the tasters---that
  is to say, we have not learned from each other and have not adopted over time the
  tasting standards of other tasters.
