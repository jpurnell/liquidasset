 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0554
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.8188. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine B is Ch. Lafite Rothschild 1966        
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine C is Ch. Brane Cantenac 1970

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  2.2143. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.8188

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The wines were lively and delicious; none of them is over the hill.       
  The Brane Cantenac 1970, first tasted in our group in 1989, was even      
  better today--despite its description by Robert Parker as 65 points, and  
  having a barnyard odor--and it had done well ten years ago.                      
  One person said, "Apparently, Parker's ratings do not extend too far in   
  the future."                                                              
  To show how dispersed preferences were, it should be noted that every wine
  was rated best by at least one person, and every wine but one was rated   
  last by at least one person.                                              
                                                                            
  Conclusion:  Many of us arrived at the tasting thinking that the wines    
  were probably going to be too old (one person said, "I want to go home"   
  when told what we were going to taste).  In fact, the wines were delicious
  today, very, very soft and quite delicious.

 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0000
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 1.0000. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.
<br>
 The correlation I measures the degree to which the identification of each 
 judge is correlated with the truth. Here a 1.0 means that the judge identified
 the wines perfectly, and a 0 means that he identified none of them.

<br>
 Next, we show the correlation among the wine identifications of the judges,
 which also ranges between 1.0 and 0.0:
<br>
     C = 0.0000
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small: < 5 %. Most people would say that unless this probability
 is less than 0.1, the judges' identifications are not highly related.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   tied for  1st place    Wine A is Ch. Ducru Beaucaillou 1979        
  2.   tied for  1st place    Wine B is Ch. Ducru Beaucaillou 1970        

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  0.0000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 1.0000

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  1.00 for significance at the 0.1 level
