 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1998
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1430. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  9.5893. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1430
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is   0.7928. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.5710 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:
 
 	These wines were opulent and ripe without great vintage variation. Served with 
	ratatouille, we certainly felt the touch of Provence in the event. They were all 
	young and exuberant. The group felt that the price/quality ratio as corroborated
	by the high (95+) Parker scores, present unique value given the current price
	range of $65-$130. Oew taster commented on the food-friendly character of these wines.
	Reactions to the winning and youngest (2010) vintage supported the accuracy
	og Jen Dunnock's description in the <em>Wine Advocate</em> as "rock star stuff."
	
    We note that one wine, the Vieux Donjon 2010, was significantly 
	liked by the tasters and one, the Vieux Donjon 2004 was sign ificantly disliked.
	Wine G, the Mont Olivet, had curious bimodal ratings: three tasters thought 
	it was the best of the wines and three thought it was the worst. Since we had 
	price information, we could determine the (rank) correlation between the prices and
	the rankings of the individual tasters: three tasters had a rank correlation 
	in excess of 0.5, with the rest of the tasters' ranks being largely
	uncorrelated with the prices.
