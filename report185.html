 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1563
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2711. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine F is Musigny Vielles Vignes Vog&uuml;e      
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine H is Vosne Roman&eacute;e Leroy               
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine E is Clos dce Tart                     
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine D is Bonnes Mares Vog&uuml;&eacute;                
  5.   tied for  5th place    Wine C is La Grande Rue Monopole            
  6.   tied for  5th place    Wine A is Chambertin Rousseau               
  7.   tied for  7th place    Wine G is Chambertin Clos de B&egrave;ze Rousseau  
  8.   tied for  7th place    Wine B is Clos de la Roche Ponsot           

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  8.7500. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.2711
<br>

  <br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  As on April 2, 1012, the group once again was privileged to taste a       
  fantastic array of top draw 2005 Burgundies. Despite one wine that in our 
  previous tasting was thought thought to be corked, in this tasting there was no corked  
  wine. The assessment of the group was that while all these grand cru      
  Burgundies were drinking wonderfully well, with little discernable differ- 
  ences between them at 10 years of bottle age, several of these wines will 
  benefit from several more years in the cellar. It is clear that the       
  top wine in this tasting and the corresponding tasting three years ago was
  the Musigny.
  
  Overall, the correlation within the group was small, with the Kendall W achieving 
  only 0.1563, which is statistically not significant. However, the most interesting 
  feature of the tasting was that it was nearly ideantical with a tasting held on 
  <a href="report158.html">April 2, 2012</a>. Seven of the eight wines were identical in the two 
  tastings for   vintage and vineyard. The Nuits St. Georges in the earlier tasting could not be
  matched and was replaced by a Vosne Roman&eacute;e from Leroy. In testing for
  intertemporal consistency one might proceed in two ways: (1) find the correlation
  between the two tastings, pretending that the non-matching winesd in each group are 
  simply called "wine other than the seven matching wines" or (2) simply omit the non-
  matching wines and find the correspondences between the two sets of remaining sev 
  en wines. We also note that seven of the eight tasters were identical in the two tastings; 
  hence as in the wines, there was not a complete duplication of the experiment but nearly so.  
  
  Using the first option, the rank correlation between the 2012 and 2015 tastings is 0.47; using the 
  second option it is 0.36, and neither of these is statistically significant at any reasonable level
  of significance. It is also clear that these results are largely driven by Clos de Tart, which scored 
  well in 2015 but was at the bottom in 2012. It is also driven by the generally low correlation 
  between the rankings of the group members. It is all the more remarkable that the Musigny achieved
  such splendid results in both tastings.
