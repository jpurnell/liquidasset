 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1506
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.3903. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine H is Chambertin A. Rousseau            
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine E is Chambertin Clos de Beze A. Roussea
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine G is Musigny Vielles Vignes Vogue      
  4.   tied for  4th place    Wine B is Bonnes Mares Vogue                
  5.   tied for  4th place    Wine A is Nuits St. Georges Leroy           
  6.   tied for  4th place    Wine D is Grande Rue Monopole

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  7.3810. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.3903

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

  COMMENT:

This tasting has been done twice before with exactly the same wines in 2012 and 2015. They are magnificent wines. It was 
hard to choose between the wines as borne out by the results. They are all brilliant clean and with a long life ahead. 
The best of Burgundy. The wines from Dom de Vogue did particularly well in all tastings. The tastings were reflective of 
the Cotes de Nuits representing 6 appellations. These wines had soft tannins and great fruit making them very 
approachable.

We have to thank our host for his marvelous cellar and ability to provide this series of matched wines. We did as 
a bonne bouche an AF Gross Richebourg 2005 which was equally magnificent.

This is the third time that we are tasting these wines. The first two occasions were April 2012 and Marchg 2015. The
tastings were identical with one exception: in the b2015 tastin g the Nuits St. Georges was replaced  by a Vosne Romanee Grand Cru. For 
this reason, the 2015 tasting cannot be strictly compared with the other two. The rank correlation between the first and the third
tasting is 0.86 which shows a fair amount of temporal consistency in the grou0p-.
