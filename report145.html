 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0914
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.7236. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine G is Moine-Hudelot 2002

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  4.4762. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.7236

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

  COMMENT:
<br>
	The wines were all delicious and none of them had any fault. This in part explains why the overall
	correlation was so low (0.0914), although one wine turned out to be consistently less liked than the 
	others (Moillard 1990). The sum of the ranks over the Comte de Vog&uuml;&eacute; wines was 126, exactly 
	the same as for the other wines; hence nothing can be said about these two groupings relative to each
	other. However, the Comte de Vog&uuml;&eacute; wines were quite a bit more expensive than the others, 
	and hence these could not be said to represent good value. 
	
	Interestingly, however, the younger wines were somewhat better liked than the older ones. Computing 
	the R-statistic over the two younger and two older vintages (See Richard E. Quandt, &quot;A Note on a Test 
	for the Sum of Ranksums,&quot;, <em>Journal of Wine Economics</em>, 2/1 (2007), 98-102) yields R= 0.8, 
	which just misses being significant at the 0.05 level of significance (the critical value being 0.78).
	
	After the rankings were obtained, we opened a ninth bottle, a 1983 Comte de Vog&uuml;&eacute;, which by 
	consensus was declared to be the best of the lot, although no completely objective comparison could be made with
	the other wines, since there was not enough left of the others for a detailed comparison.
