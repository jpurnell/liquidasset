<div class=body>Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):<br><br>    W = 0.4000<br><br>The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation is rather large,  0.1870. Most analysts would say that unless this probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly related.<br><br>We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group preference.<br>A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a perfect predictor of the group's preferences.<br>A 0.0 means no correlation, while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group. This is measured by the correlation R.<br><br></div>
<div class=table>Correlation Between the Ranks of each Person With the Average Ranking of Others

Judge       Spearman's Rho
Orley        0.8000

<div class=body>The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be significantly different.<br><br></div>
<div class=table>    1.        ........ 1st place        Wine C is 2019 Hawk Haven OA Cabernet Franc
    2.        tied for 2nd place        Wine A is 2017 Cedar Rose AV Cabernet Sauvignon

</div>
<div class=body>We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering. The Friedman Chi-Square value is  4.800. The probability that this could happen by chance is  0.187.</div>
<div class=body>We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correlations that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.<br><br></div>
<div class=body>Pairwise Rank Correlations<br><br>Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.948 for significance at the 0.05 level, and must exceed  0.909 for significance at the 0.10 level.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>COMMENT:<br><br>This tasting was unusual in that it was a rare opportunity to taste a series of wines made from grapes grown in a specific vineyard, but from different wine makers, with the vineyard owner and group member Orley Ashenfelter. The wines, all made in limited quantities, started with the wines made, somewhat unusually from the second leaf harvest in 2017 through to the more recently planted varieties of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot.<br>All the wines were extremely enjoyable to drink now with a view that the Cabernets had a few years aging to go. Interestingly the 2 Cabernets were grapes picked at the same time from the same vineyard, illustrating the difference in wine making styles.<br>Details of the vineyard and its evolution can be found https://ashenfeltervineyards.com/our-wines/<br>It highlighted what great strides the serious NJ wines have made in terms of quality and they remain very good value with prices at $35 a bottle or lower. Sadly the quantities are limited and the wines generally have to be obtained directly from the winery.<br>If you can fine these or other examples from the wineries that were part of this tasting, do not hesitate to buy and enjoy them.<br>There was also a delicious Chardonnay, served beforehand called Auburn Road, barrel reserve 2020. Again availability is the issue but at $25 a bottle it is a bargain.</div>
