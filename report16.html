 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3120
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1310. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

 Each Person With the Average Ranking of Others

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine C is L'Aigueliere, Cote Doree
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   tied for  2nd place    Wine B is La Roque, Cupa Numismae
  3.   tied for  2nd place    Wine E is Hortus, Grande Cuvee
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine I is L'Aigueliere, Fut de Chene
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine D is Lascaux, Nobles Pierres
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine G is Mansenoble, Corbiere
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine H is Mortes, Grande Cuvee
  8.   ........  8th place    Wine A is Sainte Agnes, Ermitage de Pic St L
---------------------------------------------------
  9.   ........  9th place    Wine F is Prieure de Ch de Segure, Vielles V

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 12.4800. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1310

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in
 the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

                           Pairwise Rank Correlations

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.70 for significance at the 0.05
level and must exceed  0.60 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Kai: The L'Aigueliere, Cote Doree seems to be by far to green; the Mortes
  has a rough structure; Andre: There are two different kinds of wine: the spicy
  and the fruity. The result of such a tasting depends on the preferences.
