 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2626
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0399. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 14.7083. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0399

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This was a broad selection of high qualigty Spanish wines and none of     
  them disappointed, despite the fact that they were made in different      
  styles and of different grapes  There was no standout of either region or    
  vintage year despite our quantitative results. One taster thought that    
  wine E smelled and tasted of bacon fat. It is interesting to note that     
  the winning wine was a second wine of Pingus. Another point is the  
  degree to which these wines are single grape wines vs. a blend. It is amazing  
  that we have had such a high correlation given the diversity of the wines.
