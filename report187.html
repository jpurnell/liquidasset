 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0826
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.6815. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  3.9643. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.6815

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This is the first time that the group tasted Pertimali. Despite many    
  other earlier tastings of Brunello, this tasting of Livio Sassetti       
  was the first the first time that many of the tasters experienced this wine.
  The wines were extraordinarily difficult to differentiate despite an almost 20-year time span
  betwen the youngest and the oldest wine in the tasting. There was        
  almost no difference in the rankings of the group between the ordinary 
  and riserva 2004. One member noted that the oldest wine was not only too  
  difficult to distinguish by age from a tasting standpoint but also        
  visually. It was noted the &quot;encore wine&quot; of 1975 was vibrant and would have
  scored well in the context of the earlier wines. It should also be noted that our 
  generous host cooked for us Tuscan Polpettone, which was an excellent accompaniment
  to the wines.
