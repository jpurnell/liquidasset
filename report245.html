<div class=body>Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):<br><br>    W = 0.2180<br><br>The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation is quite small,  0.0939. Most analysts would say that since this probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences appear to be strongly related.<br><br>We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group preference.<br>A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a perfect predictor of the group's preferences.<br>A 0.0 means no correlation, while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group. This is measured by the correlation R.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering. The Friedman Chi-Square value is 12.208. The probability that this could happen by chance is  0.094.</div>
<div class=body>We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correlations that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.<br><br></div>
<div class=body>Pairwise Rank Correlations<br><br>Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.697 for significance at the 0.05 level, and must exceed  0.619 for significance at the 0.10 level.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>COMMENT:<br><br>Overall this tasting was a very enjoyable tasting of Bordeaux blends that were in general 10 years of age and they were all drinking beautifully. The winner was the Pichon Baron 2016 was just coming into its own and will provide many years of pleasurable drinking. Having said that 2 lesser known properties, the Reignac and the Oculus did very well and this demonstrates that there are great strides being made by regions and areas unknown 10 years ago. <br>The Montelena which was 2004 was a little disappointing,maybe past it’s best and the eponymous Australian wine from Coonawarra was selected on its similarity to the hosts name. It came in last. </div>
