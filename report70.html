     ( 6 is the best possible,  36 is the worst)

<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3968
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0361. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine A is Nuits St Georges Vaucrains Gouges 
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine B is Volnay Champans Marquis d'Angervil
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine D is Chambertin 1985, Bouree           
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine C is Chambolle Musigny Haut Doix Groffi
---------------------------------------------------
  5.   tied for  5th place    Wine E is Nuits St Georges Las Chaillots Dub
  6.   tied for  5th place    Wine F is Savigny Les Vergelles, Duibreuil  

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 11.9048. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0361

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:
 
 Comments by Orley Ashenfelter:
 
Some may recall that we had developed data to predict the quality of red Burgundy vintages and that 
in <i>Liquid Assets</i>, we predicted 1985 would be outstanding.  Virtually all wine critics agreed with this 
assessment (Robert Parker more than any other, perhaps-though now he no longer tastes in red Burgundy!)  
and so it has never been controversial-very low rainfall at harvest, a warm, but not hot (less warm 
that 1983 but far drier), growing season are what led to this view on the part of Liquid Assets.

I have heard many complaints about this vintage-many people believe the wines have not really lived up 
to expectations.  Today we test this view, with a range of wines from many communes and levels of quality.
All the wines are premier crus except one, which is a grand cru (Chambertin, said to be Napoleon's 
favorite wine).

 Comments by the group as a whole: 
 
  There is an unusual agreement among the members of the group, in a group that does not often agree 
  completely.                              
  There was a very significant difference between wines A and B on the one hand and E and F on the other. 
  The Gouge wines are famous for being authentic and during the scandals of 1950s and 1960s he was the 
  one who stood for authentic Burgundies. The wines have extraordinary natural acidity. Some like this 
  in the Gouge wines and some don't. There is no indication that any of these wines are over the hill. 
  The purpose of tasting the wines was to see whether the widespread criticism of them was correct. 
  The criticism is not supported. The Chambertin was slow in evolving and might indeed have scored higher
  given more time. These are very tasty wines, and we all wish we had more. 
  
  Added on 1/13/2012: Upon studying the situation, it turned out that <a href="report21.html">Report 21</a> and
  the present report share 4 of the six wines in the tasting, namely the two Nuits St. George, the Volnay and the Chambertin.
  Alas, those two reports ranked these four wines quite differently: in Report 21, the Chambertin was first, the Volnay was 
  second, the N uits Vaucrains was third and the Nuits Chaillots was last. In Report 70, the present report,
  the Nuits Vaucrains was first, the Volnay was second, the Chambertin was third and the Nuits Chaillots last.
  This does not say much for intertemporal consistency.
