     ( 7 is the best possible,  49 is the worst)

<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3294
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0315. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine G is R. Ratti Barolo Rocche                          
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine D is Giuseppe Mascarello Barolo Villero        
  3.   tied for  3rd place    Wine C is Giovanni Manzone Barolo Gramolere                 
  4.   tied for  3rd place    Wine A is Giuseppe Mascarello Monprivato    
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine E is Brovia Barolo                          
---------------------------------------------------
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine F is Cavallotto Barolo Bricco Boschis                       
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine B is Marcarini Barolo Brunate                        

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 13.8367. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0315

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  These were all fantastic wines. Many people thought that they could be red
  Burgundies because they had good acidity, light color, excellent           
  bouquets,  and  sweet fruit. It was wonderful to see this quality of      
  wines at sensible prices compared to many other fine wine regions.        
  Contrary to previous thinking, the conclusions of this tasting confirm    
  that modern Barolos drink exceptionally well at ten years. This is a      
  testimony to the stature of Barolos. It is interesting that the lowest    
  ranking wine, the Marcarini, was the most tannic of all the wines.        
  But all the wines had wonderful bouquet, and on that basis alone, it was  
  difficult to distinguish between them.
  
  It should be noted that we have had a previous tasting of Barolos, namely the 
  1990s, but of course largely different ones from the ones tasted today. See
  <a href="report5.html">Report 5.</a>
  
  The overall agreement in the group was strong, which is also attested by the fact
  that most tasters' rankings were positively correlated with one another.
                                      
  Yet again we found ourselves in  disagreement with Parker in that his   
  lowest rated wine in this group ended up in the middle of the pack.        
  Let this be another reminder that your own tastes should dictate your own  
  preference and we encourage you to explore Barolo.
