 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2594
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0812. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine E is 1988                              
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine C is 1996                              
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine D is 1990                              
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine A is 1994

  5.   ........  5th place    Wine B is 1992                              

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  8.3000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0812
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is  -0.3000. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.8000 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.90 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This was the first occasion since the pandemic began that we all          
  attended in person in the lovely garden bower of one of our members. This 
  was a great joy to all attendees. 
  
  The wines were delicious and there was noticeable agreement in the group. It was interesting that the oldest wine
  was the favorite of the group/ These wines clearly age well. The two most expensive wines were the group's least favorite.
  Four members had a negative correlation with the pridce and only one member had a substantial positive correlation with the price.
  In any event, the wines were delicious.
