 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1095
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.6323. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine C is Vina Arana Reserva, Bod. Alta Rioja
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine B is Conde de Valdemar Reserva 1985    
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine I is Conde de Valdemar Gran Reserva 19
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine F is Marques de Caceres Reserva 1970   
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine G is Federico Paternina O. Gran Reserva 1961
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine D is Marques de Villamagna Gran Reserva
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine E is Castillo Ygay 1959 Marques de Murrieta
  8.   tied for  8th place    Wine H is Marques de Riscal 1973            
  9.   tied for  8th place    Wine A is Marques de Riscal 1966            

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  6.1333. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.6323

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.70 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.60 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The tasting was over a wide range of vintages of Spanish wines, from      
  1959 to 1986. While gthe agreement in the group was not strong, the       
  only pattern that emerged that the younger wines were preferred to the    
  older ones, that obviously did not hold up as well. Testing the group     
  of wines from the 1980s against the remainder shows that the wines of     
  the 1980s were significantly preferred to the others.
