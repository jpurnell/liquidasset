 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0688
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.8194. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  4.4000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.8194

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.70 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.60 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  All the wines drank well and were pretty obviously ready to drink; no flawed bottles were
  found. The rank averages were 42.75 for the L&eacute;oville las Cases, 39 for the L&eacute;oville
  Poyferr&eacute; and 36 for the L&eacute;oville Barton; if anything in reverse order of their prices. 
  But comparing the pair with the biggest difference, the Las Cases and the Barton, shows no
  significant difference, and so we can say that these wines are to all intents and purposes
  identical in quality in the tasters' estimation. Essentially the same conclusion is reached if one
  compares the vintages '95, '96 and '97, with the 1997 vintage marginally ahead of the other two. On
  the whole, the wines were perceived to be very similar, which is underscored by the fact that the 
  correlation in the group was essentially zero.
