 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1801
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1839. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine E is Musigny, Vielles Vignes, Vog&uuml;&eacute;   
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine F is Chambertin, Rousseau              
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine H is Nuits St Georges, Leroy

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 10.0833. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1839

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Today we were privileged to taste a fantastic array of top drawer 2005      
  Burgundies. With the only exception of the Clos de Tart, which a number of us   
  felt was a slightly flawed bottle, all the wines lived up to expectations
  Basically, the wines were very similar in many ways, and we will be      
  tasting these every other year for the next 10 years. Not only will we   
  see how they change, but we will be able to test for intertemporal con-
  sistency, provided that we are still all able to participate.           
                                                                            
  Some of these wines could handle a few more years in the bottle, in that they had       
  noticeable tannins.  
  
  It is also interesting to observe that the Clos de la Roche and the Musigny provoked
  some extreme opinions, in that the former garnered four votes for being the worst and 
  two votes of being either first or second, while the latter garnered five votes of 
  being either first or second and two votes of second to bottom.
