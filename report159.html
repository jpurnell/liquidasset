 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1050
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.6216. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine C is Chave Hermitage 1990              
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine A is Chave Hermitage 1989              
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine D is Chave Hermitage 1988              
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine B is Chave Hermitage 1985              
  5.   tied for  5th place    Wine E is Chave Hermitage 1998              
  6.   tied for  5th place    Wine G is Chave Hermitage 1994              
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine F is Chave Hermitage 2000              

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  4.4082. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.6216

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:
 
  Much to our delight, our host poured the mature, delicious 1997 and 1999 Mayacamas Chardonnay's 
  as we gathered before this wine tasting. 

  Overall, this was a fantastic tasting of consistent and typical wines of  
  the great Hermitage Appelation. There is a great consistency of style    
  across the vintages that is typical of the appelation and the house.      
  Several tasters noted that as the tasting was going on that they changed their 
  ranking an unusual number of times.
                                         
  There was wide agrement that these wines have noticeable acidity and would
  be excellent with a meal.
                                                   
  These wines are all very expensive, averaging about $225-$250/bottle.          
  We conclude that while there may be preference differences among the judges,
  these were such fantastic wines that they were all judged to be excellent.                
  
  One taster, Bob, noted that he was rather negative in his evaluation of wine C,
  the 1990, but that might be explained by the fact that his glass was filled
  from the bottom of the bottle and thus had unusual amount of dregs in it. We there-
  fore reran the computer programwithou Bob. The new Kendall W turned out to be
  0.2063, overall still not significant (the probability that it could have
  occurred by chance now being 0.2830, quite a bit lower than the 0.6216 we had before).
  However, wine C now turns out to be significantly high in quality. Of course, we don't
  mean this literally, since once you have computed statistics from the data, you really can't
