<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.4537
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0080. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine E is Diamond Creek ????                
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   tied for  2nd place    Wine D is Louis Martini 1963A               
  3.   tied for  2nd place    Wine C is Louis Martini 1965                
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine A is Robert Mondavi 1966               
  5.   tied for  5th place    Wine B is Souverain 1966                    
  6.   tied for  5th place    Wine G is Concannon 1968                    
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine H is Charles Krug 1960

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 19.0556. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0080

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

Comments:

It is amazing that these 40-50 year old wines were as good as they were. It is clear 
that these vineyards produced good and long-lasting wines; it is also clear that bottle 
variation is a very important factor, as witnessed by the two 1963 Martini wines (19 
points against for one and 47 points against the other). It is also to be noted that
California was making high-quality Cabernet Sauvignons before the 1976 "Judgment of Paris" 
and that happened to age as long as they did. But a fair question is how much longer these 
wines are likely to last.

The agreement among the judges is very strong. Yet one may suspect that it is driven, at least
in part, by the general dislike of one of the 1963 Louis Martini wines. As an exercise, 
without claiming statistical significance for this result, we reranked the wines as if wine F, 
the 1963 Martini that ranked lowest, did not exist. It turns out that the Kendall W coefficiant of
concordance is now 0.2282, and the probability that this could have occurred by chance is 0.2228; 
hence this result is by no means significant. The Charles Krug, which was the 7th ranked wine
before, is still 7th ranked and is now statistically "bad", which is not an unexpected result.
