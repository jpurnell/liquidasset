 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0671
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.8574. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine F is Kistler Pinot Noir Cuvee Elizabeth
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine E is Chambertin, Leroy                 
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine D is Musigny, Leroy                    
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine H is Musigny Vielles Vignes Comte de Vog&uuml;e
  5.   tied for  5th place    Wine G is Romanee St. Vivant, Leroy         
  6.   tied for  5th place    Wine A is Kistler Pinot Noir Cuvee Catherine
  7.   ........  7th place    Wine B is Romanee St. Vivant DRC            
  8.   ........  8th place    Wine C is Romanee Conti, DRC                

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  3.2857. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.8574

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  No oxidized or corked wines; everything as it should be. All of the wines 
  were extraordinary and there was very little difference in  the votes for 
  the eight wines. Note that one of the Kistlers (cuvee Elizabeth, wine A) was      
  accidentally a 2006 and not a 2002. The group, though not significantly   
  predictive, seemed to divide into a group that liked the house style of   
  the Leroy wines and the group that did not. It is interesting to note,    
  which partly explains the overall lack of agreement, that one taster      
  ranked the Leroy wines 1, 2, and 3; while another ranked them 6, 7 and 8  
  This strongly suggest that people who suggest that terroir is all that    
  matters (i.e., only the vineyard matters) have not tasted enough of the   
  best wines. Our host was very brave to insert the Kistler wines in a      
  group of this stature from France, and the American wines were in the     
  first and fifth places, above the average. The wines from Domaine    
  Leroy were all young enough to have been produced by the method biodynamic.
  Surprising to some, in the comparisons between the DRC and the Leroy   
  wines, the biodynamic wines were the winners by a substantial margin.And in
  the faceoff between the Musignys the biodynamic, Leroy won by a small margin.
