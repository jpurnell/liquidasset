 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3003
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0038. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is Opus One 1994

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 24.3212. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0038

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.65 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.56 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT (Prepared by Orley Ashenfelter):

For the Francophiles in the group this tasting was a shock.  The wines were served randomly using an ingenious 
design due to our host, Burt Malkiel.  The tasting consisted of 10 wines: 5 Opus I bottles from 5 different vintages 
(1982, 1989, 1990, 1994, and 1997) and 5 Bordeaux first growths from each of the same 5 vintages.  There were three key 
results.    
   
The Opus I 1994 was the overall top wine (significantly so) and the 1990 Mouton was at the bottom (significantly so also).  
In addition, in each vintage Opus I gathered more favorable results than the comparable French wine.  This was perhaps most 
especially shocking in the case of the comparison of the 1982 Lafite and Opus I, as the former is rated 100 points by 
Robert Parker.  Moreover, the usual argument is that the Bordeaux wines will fare better when they are older, certainly 
not the case here.  (However, at least one person in the group stated that the 82 Lafite is  notoriously unreliable, possibly 
due to the fact that in 1982 very limited selection within the vineyard was made. This is borne out by the production then 
which was almost double todays level. Visitors to the chateau have heard this used as a justification as to why todays wines 
are so much better (and more expensive). Of course it does not offer much consolation to those who are prepared to spend the 
+$700 at auction for this wine today. We do not have any independent evidence to support this assertion, of course.)

Each person was asked to guess whether a wine was an Opus (CA) or First Growth (FR).  In fact, only one person was very 
successful at this, and he (Mark Massad) was the very generous contributor of the Opus wines---showing his familiarity with them 
and his generosity.  In short, no one was able to pinpoint the origin of the wines, though the group generally preferred the 
Opus wines. It would be fair to say the wines are made in a style very similar to that of a First Growth.

The similarity of the wines is perhaps no accident as, historically, the Opus wines were a joint venture of Robert Mondavi 
and Chateau Mouton-Rothschild.  Opus I is now a 50/50 joint venture between Constellation (the purchaser of the Robert Mondavi 
enterprise) and Baron Philipe de Rothschild S.A. (the owners of Mouton Rothschild).  The Opus property is administered by a 
separate board of directors and has a distinctly separate management team. The winery is the first major American producer to 
use the Bordeaux negociant system for worldwide distribution (the same method used by first growths).  [The information in 
this paragraph was kindly provided by Ted Hall, who was Chairman of the Robert Mondavi Board at the time of its sale.]
