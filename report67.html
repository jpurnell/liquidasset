     ( 5 is the best possible,  35 is the worst)

<br>
 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1886
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.4627. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine C is Heitz Martha's Vineyard 1985      
---------------------------------------------------

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  5.6571. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.4627

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:<br><br>
 This tasting was
indeed a tribute to the Joseph Heitz wines of the early/mid-80s.  They were
all outstanding, and holding up extremely well validating a point that at
least these California cabernets are long lived.  There is a typical mint
flavor in these wines characteristic of Heitz.  The winner was Martha's
Vineyard 1985 followed in 2nd by the Bella Oaks 1985, suggesting that the
vintage year was the most important determinate in the tasting. <br> <br>

  It is interesting to note that three of the four highest rated wines were 
  ranked best by at least one taster and were also ranked worst by at least 
  one taster. This high dispersion among opinions suggests that there might 
  have been style differences among the wines that had differential appeal  
  among the tasters.  </p>
