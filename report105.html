 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3061
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0454. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine G is Beaulieu Vin. Cabernet Sauv. 1966 
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine E is Louis Martini PN 1962             
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine A is Christian Broth. PN St. George 196
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine F is Heitz PN 1963                     
  5.   tied for  5th place    Wine B is Inglenook PN 1965                 
  6.   tied for  5th place    Wine C is Beringer PN 1960s

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 12.8571. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0454

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  These comments apply to two separate wine tastings.  The first was intended to be a tasting
  of 7 California pinot noirs from the 1960s, but by accident a cabernet sauvignon was included in the
  blind tasting, while we thought that we had seven pinot noirs. The second tasting was
  of 4 California cabernets of the 1960s. Several wines had no vintage indication, and these are
  denoted in the above table identifying the wines as &quot;1960s.&quot; The present report contains
  the results of the pinot noir tasting; for the cabernet sauvignon tasting see <a href="report106.html">Report 106</a>.
  
  The wines were obtained by one of us, John Lowrance, by purchase of a cellar from a widow whose 
  husband had collected the wines, but who did not sell them until many years after her late husband’s 
  death.  The wines taken together provide a remarkable view of a collector locked in a time warp 
  of the 1960s.  This collector’s red Bordeaux wines from the period make up a list that would be 
  both financially valuable and recognizable to wine lovers anywhere. The California pinots from this 
  period now have fallen into anonymity.  The California cabernets from this period are remembered by 
  a few, but they have also fallen by the wayside.

  First we provide some comments on the pinots.  We opened the wines in advance of the event expecting 
  to find that some (perhaps all) would be oxidized.  To find the 7 wines in the tasting we were forced 
  to eliminate 4 that were oxidized —-- an Almaden NV, 1966 and 1967 Robert Mondavi’s, and a Paul Masson NV.  
  The wines without vintage dates were almost certainly from the 1960s.  It is ironic that at one time 
  both the Masson and Almaden names would have attracted a collector’s interest.  This is a common piece 
  of history in California —-- indeed, one could argue that the Mondavi wines (this would have been nearly 
  the first vintage for Robert Mondavi) have come full circle, as Mondavi has now been sold to the 
  largest wine company in the world (Constellation), which has just recently announced missing its 
  quarterly net income target!

  Ironically, one of the top wines was a Beaulieu Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon Private Reserve 1966 --—
  which had been served blind and put in the wrong tasting!  In retrospect this might have been useful, 
  since the BVPR provides a benchmark for the wines --— it is probably one of the best known &quot;quality wines&quot; 
  from the period.  By that standard the pinots did well, which may come as something of a shock to those 
  who think that pinot in California dates from the era of the movie &quot;Sideways.&quot;  The wines had noticeable
  fruit characters but not noticeable pinot fruit characters.  John Lowrance commented &quot;it is remarkable 
  any of the wines are still good, many expensive red Burgundies of this age are shot.&quot; As a whole the 
  group found the wines interesting and drinkable, but they were not great fans of them today.  Bob 
  Levine commented, &quot;The three best wines of the tasting remain fresh and vibrant.&quot;  Ironically, two of 
  the wineries, providing 3 of the wines, no longer exist—Christian Brothers and Inglenook --— and the Gallo 
  family has purchased the Louis Martini winery recently.  Of the remaining wineries, none is well known 
  for pinot noir today.

  The cabernet tasting was similar in some ways, different in others.  With only 5 tasters remaining we 
  settled on sampling 4 wines.  First, we opened three bottles of Livermore Valley’s Concannon cabernet 
  (a vertical as it turned out —-- 1963, 1964 and 1965) that were oxidized before settling on the 4 wines in 
  the tasting.  These 4 wines were lovely and clearly were fresh with good fruit flavors.  The surprise 
  in the group was the Opici wine, a brand historically associated with jug wines.  This particular 
  bottle was a &quot;limited release&quot; from a separate vineyard called &quot;Green Ranch,&quot; but where this is has 
  been lost to history apparently.  The three top wines were from 3 of the top producers in their day.  
  The Krug wine was the family winery for the Mondavi’s before the split in that family.  The great wine 
  producer John Daniel ran Inglenook, while the renowned Lee Stewart then ran Souverain.  At that time 
  Souverain was a Napa winery up on Howell Mountain (unlike the brand today, which is in Sonoma) and 
  Stewart provided the first employment for both Mike Grgich and Warren Winiarski (the producers of the 
  winning cabernet and chardonnay wines in the famous Paris taste-off).

  We are indebted to John Lowrance for purchasing these wines and for one very enjoyable look at 
  California wine history.
