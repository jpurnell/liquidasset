<div class=body>Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):<br><br>    W = 0.1615<br><br>The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation is rather large, 0.2497. Most analysts would say that unless this probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly related.<br><br>We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group preference.<br>A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a perfect predictor of the group's preferences.<br>A 0.0 means no correlation, while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.

<div class=body>We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering. The Friedman Chi-Square value is  9.042. The probability that this could happen by chance is  0.250.</div>
<div class=body>We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correlations that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>COMMENT:<br><br>Overall this was a very Interesting tasting of Pinot Noirs from recent vintages. It also represented a comparison between recent top CA wines and French Burgundy with an Oregon Pinot Noir as a wild card. All the wines were fun and really enjoyable to drink. <br>At this price point $100-200 this represented the high end of CA Pinot and premier cru burgundy. In this tasting the Kistler was significantly preferred. The Beaune from 2020 was seen as statistically inferior, although it should be noted that this was the lowest cost ($71) of all the wines except the Oregon Pinot. Kistler in particular has been a top performer in a number of different tastings over the past few years. This raises the question of how well the Kistler would do versus some of the higher end Burgundy.<br>So far there have been 2 conclusions.<br>- the optimal age of these wines appears to be around 7 years.<br>- should alternatives such as Burgundy be compared when they are at their peak of maturity, why may be much older?<br><br>We also looked at alcohol levels and cost. Although the range of prices was between $25 and $222. The top wines were in the $160 to $180 range. Given the prevalence of warm vintages during the tasting timeframe of 2019-22 it should not be that surprising that the top 5 wines were all 13.9-14.4% with the Aubert wine that came second being a high 16.2%. <br>Alcohol levels did not appear to impact the tasters individual preferences. <br><br>Overall it demonstrated how enjoyable, even at a relatively young age Pinot Noir is to drink. <br></div>
