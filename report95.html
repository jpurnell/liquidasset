 We now measure the amount of correlation (W) among the judges:                 
 W = 1.0 => perfect correlation, W = 0 => no correlation                        
<br>
 We also provide a probability measure that this correlation is due to chance   
<br>
 In this case the correlation is =     0.5536                                   
<br>
 Probability that correlation is due to chance = 0.0387                         
<br>
We compute the correlation of each taster with the average ranking of the oth-  
ers and with prices. 1.0 => perfect, 0 => none, -1.0 => total disagreement
