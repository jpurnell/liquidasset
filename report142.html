 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0960
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.6143. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   tied for  1st place    Wine C is Enrique Foster Limited Edition 2003

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  5.3750. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.6143

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  These wines were incredibly similar and all were very delicious but not        
  very interesting in the bouquet, although not unpleasant. They would be good   
  wines with steak, rich cheeses and pat&eacute;s. These are  very interesting     
  wines, according to one participant, and they are  not cheap and          
  cheerful and they are serious wines. They seem to mature successfully   
  at an early age and hold their plateau.  It is interesting to note that the
  three most expensive wines ranked at the bottom of our rankings. There seemed to
  be no pattern favoring the relative younger or older wines. In any event, it would
  be interesting to see what happens to these wines in another ten years or more.
  Overall, a great start for the new season.
