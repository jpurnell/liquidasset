 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1451
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.3217. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   tied for  1st place    Wine A is Ch. Lafite-Rothschild 1978

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  8.1250. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.3217
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is  -0.6386. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.5240 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  These wines were from the cellar of one member of the group and were in   
  excellent cellaring conditions; so these comments are for wines from      
  an excellent cellar.  Despite the fact that the wines are rarely talked   
  about in the wine press any more, we found them to be uniformly excellent 
  for the dinner table today.                                               
  These wines are representative of classic clarets in the British sense    
  i.e., they combine austerity with good fruit but a noticeable lack of     
  bombastic character. While they were all mature, they have another 5-10   
  years to go. Incidentally, they all had a superb bouquet. While there was 
  not a single wine that the group judged to be of significantly highest    
  quality, four of the wines received essentially the highest score.        
  These were Lafite, Leoville, Haut Brion and Petrus.                       
  These wines do not have high points in Parker's books and those expecting 
  the fruit bomb, bombastic wines will be disappointed.
