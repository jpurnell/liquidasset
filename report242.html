<div class=body>Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):<br><br>    W = 0.3691<br><br>The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation is rather large,  0.1003. Most analysts would say that unless this probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly related.<br><br>We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group preference.<br>A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a perfect predictor of the group's preferences.<br>A 0.0 means no correlation, while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group. This is measured by the correlation R.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be significantly different.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering. The Friedman Chi-Square value is  9.229. The probability that this could happen by chance is  0.100.</div>
<div class=body>We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correlations that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.<br><br></div>
<div class=body>Pairwise Rank Correlations<br><br>Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.801 for significance at the 0.05 level, and must exceed  0.728 for significance at the 0.10 level.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>COMMENT:<br><br>Overall this was a tasting of a very hard to to get outside of Canada winery that is very well thought of. The wines would hold their own against the very top Bordeaux, which is the style that they are modeled on. The wines were fresh and in the style of Bordeaux they still felt very young, yet they were approachable and a pleasure to drink now. This approachability may be helped by the high levels of Merlot at around 50%. Could these wines be from the right bank? The percentage of Cab Franc may be the factor that makes these wines so approachable. <br>This was a fantastic tasting imported personally by our host from CAN. <br>Maybe this is a wine we should be asking for to get it in the US?</div>
