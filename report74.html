 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.4937
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0011. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 24.1905. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0011

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  It is appropriate that we were tasting Tokaji wines on the 156th anniversary
  of the outbreak of the Hungarian rebellion against the House of Hapsburg. Tokaji wines are produced in 
  the Tokaj-Hegyalja of Northeast Hungary, as well as in Slovakia, because the northernmost tip of 
  that region stretches into Slovakia. Wine C is a Slovak Tokaji wine. The "puttonyos" designation 
  (putnov&yacute; in Slovak) denotes the number of 28-30 liter tubs of botrysed berry mash added 
  to a 136-140 liter barrel of must. Generally, the higher the puttonyos number, the sweeter the
  wine. For details, see Miles Lambert G&oacute;cs, "Keep Young and Beautiful," <i>Harpers</i>, 
  January 23, 2004.
  
  The wine made by Holl&oacute;k&ouml;i Mih&aacute;ly (wine F) was extraordinary, especially   
  because it is only 5 puttonyos, and competitive with the Eszencia we      
  tasted. But Holl&oacute;k&ouml;i is one of the foremost small producers, and this should 
  perhaps be no surprise. Wine D suffered unduly because of its appearance: cloudy and near 
  the bottom of the bottle, muddy. Wine B was last placed and some people   
  thought it was corked.The three puttonyos, wine G, was much lighter in    
  color and many thought it was the youngest wine, which it was. Several    
  people thought that after E, A and F, there was a huge quality gap.
