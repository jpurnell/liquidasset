 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1866
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2503. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine G is 2000                              
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine B is 2003                              
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine C is 2002

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  7.8367. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.2503

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  It is interesting that the two wines that were the lowest rated by the
  group were the oldest wines, 1995 and 1996. Conversely, the younger       
  wines were preferred by the group. In fact, the oldest wines were ranked  
  as a group at the bottom, the youngest wines were ranked second from top,
  and the middle-aged wines were ranked at the top. Clos Martinet is among  
  the younger top growths of the Priorat region; thus, we might expect    
  that the younger vintages were produced before the current status of      
  of the wine  was achieved. All these wines were extremely drinkable now   
  and very lovely in every respect. Even the youngest wine was not too      
  young to drink. While these wines are delicious; it should be noted that   
  with the exception of the 1995 (13.5%) all these wines are between 14.0 an
  and 14.5 % alcohol, which may aid their enjoyment but does require a      
  certain degree of caution.
