 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.5732
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0012. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is Ch. Margaux 1962                  
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine F is Ch. Mouton Rothschild 1962        
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine A is Ch. Haut Brion 1962               
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine E is Ch. Lafite Rothschild 1962        
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine C is Ch. Cheval Blanc 1962             
---------------------------------------------------
  6.   ........  6th place    Wine B is Ch. Villars 1962                  

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 20.0612. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0012

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The Villars was an oxidized wine, and therefore, not very surprisingly, it
  placed last unanimously. The remaining wines could be grouped into two    
  sets: one set included Mouton, Haut Brion, Lafite and Cheval Blanc. The   
  other set contained Margaux only. All the wines were of very fine         
  quality, with the exception of Villars. The wines are characterized by     
  their elegant nose and flavor characteristics; interestingly the nose     
  was initially assertive but faded in the glass in a few minutes. But      
  the majority of these wines was surprisingly youthful in color and in     
  tannic structure.
