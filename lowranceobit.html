<strong>John Lee Lowrance 1932 &ndash;2011</strong><br><br><img src="lowrancesmall.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="241" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" align="left">


One of our friends and a member of our wine group died Thursday, Oct. 6, 2011, after a brief illness with 
pancreatic cancer.
John&acute;s involvement with the group goes beyond the first tasting report recorded on this site on March 9th, 1998. 
John&acute;s tastings were always thoughtfully assembled and reflected his intellectual curiosity in his choice of 
wines whether they were from ancient Bordeaux, young Argentinian malbec or Japanese Saki. He rarely missed a 
tasting and was always one of the first to arrive.
John was a southern gentleman, kind and generous and we shall miss his contented smile at our future gatherings.
