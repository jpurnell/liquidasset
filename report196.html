 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1987
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1333. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine G is Mocali Vigna Raunate Riserva      
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine F is Uccelliera Riserva

  4.   ........  4th place    Wine D is casanova di Neri                  
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine E is Pieve Santa Restiuta Rennina      
  6.   tied for  6th place    Wine B is Casanova di Neri Riserva          
  7.   tied for  6th place    Wine A is Valdicava

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 11.1250. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1333
<br>

   We now test whether the group ranking of wines is correlated with the     
 prices of the wines. The rank correlation between them is  -0.4578. At the 
 10% level of significance this would have to exceed the critical value of   
  0.5240 to be significant.

<br>

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This was a horizontal tasting of 2004 Brunello di Montalcino; a top       
  vintage for Brunello. The wines were a selection of riservas and ordinary 
  Brunellos of top scoring wines. Generally the riservas are double the price
  of the regular wines and they have an additional year in oak barrels before
  being released. The wines were double decanted and poured 2 hours before the
  tasting commenced. Interestingly, the two top wines were     
  riservas and for one wine (Uccelleria, we tasted both the regular and     
  the riserva wines for the same vintage.) The three smallest production     
  wines finished 1, 2 and 3. Overall, the wines were of uniform high quality, 
  drinking beautifully but with a clear potential for another 10 years.                                              
                                                                            
  One could conclude that the good regular Brunellos are worth buying. The  
  riservas are double the price and it is hard to generalize as to which we
  prefer. The two top wines were riservas, but with only the Mocali being 
  significantly superior, the argument could still be made that it is better 
  in a top vintage to buy more of the top scoring regular wines. Some people 
  might think that these wines are too old; however, hat is not true. 
  
  It is interesting to note that none of the tasters had a strong positive
  correlation with the price (although some had a weak correlation).
