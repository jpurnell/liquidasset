 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2240
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0841. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine G is Volnay Santenots 1er Cru 1999

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 12.5417. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0841

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The wiones were all delicious, with relatively small differences among them. Four of the eight wines were grand cru and the emaining eight
   premier cru. An obvcious test is to see if there is a significant difference between these two groups. The answer is
   in the negative; while the ranksum for the grand cru wines is slightly smalller than for the premier cru wines, the
   differendce is not significant. A similar test can be performed between the group of four relatively young wines and
   the group of relatively older ones, and again no significant difference is found.
