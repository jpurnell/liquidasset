 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3003
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0620. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine C is Mazis Chambertin 2001 Faivelet    
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   tied for  2nd place    Wine A is Griotte Chambertin 1997 Chezeaux  
  3.   tied for  2nd place    Wine D is Charmes Chambertin 1995 Laurent   
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine F is Latrici&egrave;res Chambertin 2005 Potel 
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine E is Chambertin Clos de B&egrave;ze 2000 Drouh

  6.   ........  6th place    Wine B is Gevrey Chambertin 1995 Groffier   

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 10.5102. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0620

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The tasting was entitled Chambertin and his cousins and featured six      
  Chambertins of various types and vintages ranging from 1995 to 2005.  The wines were absoluitely
  delicious. Most of the wines have age on them and they are all holding up well. The outlier was the village wine
  whjich performed poorly.This supports the superiority of the grands crus and they performed as expected.
  Burgundy has proved once again that it is a rare pleasure to enjoy these wines; terrific wines with some
  overwhelming bouquets. The correlation among the group was unusually high.
