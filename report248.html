<div class=body>Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):<br><br>    W = 0.1365<br><br>The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation is rather large, 0.5357. Most analysts would say that unless this probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly related.<br><br>We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group preference.<br>A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a perfect predictor of the group's preferences.<br>A 0.0 means no correlation, while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group. This is measured by the correlation R.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering. The Friedman Chi-Square value is  4.095. The probability that this could happen by chance is  0.536.</div>
<div class=body>We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correlations that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.<br><br></div>
<div class=body>Pairwise Rank Correlations<br><br>Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.812 for significance at the 0.05 level, and must exceed  0.740 for significance at the 0.10 level.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>COMMENT:<br><br>Overall this was a most enjoyable tasting of Gevrey Chambertin wines, spanning 25 years. The wines were all of high quality and were drinking beautifully, despite the wide range of ages and as can be seen from the correlation between the tasters, they were difficult to draw distinctions between the individual wines, with the 2 highest ranked wines being at both ends of the age range. It also sought to demonstrate the sheer quality of these Grand Cru wines from Gevrey Chambertin.<br>The host started us off with a 2005 Bonneau du Martray 2005 Corton Charlemagne, magnificent proof of how good White Burgundy can be once again, post pre-mox.<br>We finished with a marvelous  6 puttonyos Tokaji and a 1927 Solera Alvear Pedro Ximenez which stole the show with its hints of marzipan and dried fruits.</div>
