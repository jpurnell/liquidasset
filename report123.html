 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2468
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0975. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 12.0952. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0975

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The group expressed significant preference for the Thelema wines in the   
  the tasting. The sum of the ranksums for the Thelema wines is 70 and for 
  the Meerlust wines 182; the value of the R-statistic (see <em>Journal of 
  Wine Economics</em>, Vol. 2, No. 1, May 2007, p. 99) is 0.641, which is 
  significant at the .05 level. The exception was the 2001 Meerlust. Our 
  impression is that these wines are easily affordable, pleasant wines to drink. 
  These vintages would generally be available only at the winery in South Africa 
  and many of them deserved the cellaring our host gave them.
