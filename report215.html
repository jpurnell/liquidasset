 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2467
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0657. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine C is Clonakilla Shi/Vio 2015           
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine F is Jacob's Creek Shi NV              
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine E is Lakes Folly Cab 2014              
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine B is Two Hands Shi 2014

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 11.8393. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0657

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.79 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.71 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  All these wines, to the surprise of some, are very elegant. These are     
  mostly limited release, small-batch wines. It is clear that these are     
  very young wines that will improve with age. Our host obtained these    
  very dsifficult to get wines through the good graces of the Fox family    
  of Melbourne, Australia who are well known for their connection with     
  vineyards and fine wine. While  all  of these wines are young, they      
  are universally approachable. The alcohol in these wines is quite         
  restrained, between  12.5% and 14%. Our host intended that the 1975       
  Grange Hermitage be included in the tasting, but the bottle failed to     
  survive intact.                                                           
                                                                            
  We note that the group exhibited a most unusual degree of agreement,      
  with one wine being significantly liked, and one significantly disliked.
