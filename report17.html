 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3793
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0003. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine A is Federico Paternina Reserva Especia
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine B is La Rioja Alta Gran Reserva Cosecha

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 30.7212. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0003

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.65 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.56 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  There was no flaw or oxidized wine in the tasting. All wines had good     
  colors, no off smells, and they had good fruit. Ed says that he is        
  extremely surprised by the difference the 1961 Paternina Reserva Especial 
  and the Paternina Grand Reserva of the same year. One question this       
  raises is whether this is bottle variation or actual quality difference.  
  Both corks fell apart upon extraction, both were reasonably high shoul-   
  der. Frank was more surprised that both 1961s showed up so well. Several  
  people were surprised by the longevity of these wines. John notes that    
  the third best wine is a 1995, which is unusual because Riojas have to    
  age more. Ed further notes that these are not fat wines. 
  
  Dick further notes that the statistical measures of correlation among the judges
  indicate absolutely exceptional agreement among the judges.
