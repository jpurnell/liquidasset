 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1040
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.6483. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine B is 2007                              
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine A is 2006                              
  3.   ........  3rd place    Wine F is 2009                              
  4.   ........  4th place    Wine C is 1994                       
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine E is 2014                              
  6.   tied for  6th place    Wine D is Overture

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  5.0952. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.6483

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  This is a wine made in a very consistent style. It appears to perform     
  well beyond the usual vintage classifications. All the wines were         
  delicious and ready to drink.  It was noticeable that the second          
  wine of Opus One, the Overture, was not noticeably different from its     
  first wine peers. (Our estimate based on the date of purchase in 2014     
  assumed it to be blend of 2009, 10 and 11. Especial thanks to Mark        
  Massad, an Opus aficionado, for contributing two of the wines we drank    
  tonight.
