 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3333
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1353. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine A is Lytton Springs Zinfandel 1990     
---------------------------------------------------
  2.   tied for  2nd place    Wine B is Geyserville Zinfandel 1987        
  3.   tied for  2nd place    Wine C is Geyserville Zinfandel 1986        

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  4.0000. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1353

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.
                                                                                
                           Pairwise Rank Correlations                           
                                                                                
Correlations must exceed in absolute value  1.00 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  1.00 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:
 
  Just three wines, two (1986 and 1987) are from the original Trentadue
  Vineyard in the Geyserville appellation in Sonoma &mdash; these vines were torn out
  after the 1987 harvest and the vineyard was leased to another winery. These two
  wines were released in Ridge's ATP program, and they will neveer be reproduced.
  The 1990 was from the Lytton Springs appellation, Norton and Valley Vista vineyards. 
  Can we tell the Geyserville wines from the Lytton Springs wines?
  
  Paul Draper, still the wine maker at Ridge, made these wines. His wine making 
  follows the Bordeaux recipe, pumpimg over the cap, barrel aging/ Many people think 
  these are one of the few examples of a wine unique to Calufornia.

  It was noticeable to one member of the group that, in strong contrast      
  to his previous experience of Califconia Zinfandels, these three wines     
  had a striking similarity to good Bordeaux.                              
                                                                            
  Several tasters were surprised that the youngest wine, i.e. the 1990,      
  appeared to be the most mature and tannin-free bottle.                    
                                                                            
  If we had tasted 1986 in isolation, we would never have thought that it   
  was a Zinfandel that was 30 years old. With so few wines and relatively few
  tasters, we did not really expect significant results in the rankings, but
  the 1990 turned out to be significantly superior.
