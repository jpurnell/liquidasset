 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.4777
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0004. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 26.7500. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0004

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The Pomerol, Ch.l'Evangile, is showing up as the overall best wine taking both years into 
  account. The 1995s are clearly preferred over the 1994s, and in fact each 
  of the 1995s was preferred over the 1994 from the same Chateau. The best thing   
  is that they are probably not ready, notwithstanding what Parker says     
  about them. The Pichon 1995 was rated as an exceptional wine by all but   
  one taster. One the whole they all tasted quite drinkable and none were   
  too tannic.
