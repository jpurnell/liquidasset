 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2046
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.1198. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 11.4583. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.1198

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  Overall, these wines display a very consistent house style of classic    
  cabernet blend wines from Napa. They were all delicious and they all      
  displayed a density of color that was opaque and therefore misleading for 
  the older wines. It is extraordinary that the blend wine, Overture, is as good as     
  it is since it is only half the price of the others. It was  striking and
  a compliment of this outstanding producer that they have maintained       
  a consistency of style for more than a generation. It is interesting     
  that the number 1 and the number 2 demonstrate this point of consistency  
  However, the two oldest wines were  the lowest ranked wines in the        
  group. On revisiting the older wines, which had been decanted, at the     
  end of the tasting, some of us felt that they had further developed in    
  that glass and have become more appealing. The Overture is the            
  revelation. If anyone is interested in trying (a baby Opus) they          
  should seek out the Overture which is non-vintage.
