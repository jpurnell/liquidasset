 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.3757
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0037. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is 21.0417. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0037

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  All the wines were wonderful and drinking very well and they were         
  characteristic southern Rh&ocirc;ne wines. It should be noted that one of the wines,
  the 1999 Gigondas was available only in magnumn size; its identity was unknown to
  all tasters except the host of the tasting. This tasting and the success of the  
  1999 Gigondas highlight the magnum effect on all well made wines,        
  because it enhances the freshness of the wine. With the exception of      
  1998 Ch&acirc;teauneuf du Pape Barbe Rac by Chapoutier, which is a renowned wine, in a great   
  vintage, in every other vintage the Ch&acirc;teauneuf du Papes were  
  beaten by the Gigondas. While this is an important finding, overall, the advantage of 
  the Gigondas was not overwhelming: the sum of the ranks for the four Gigondas wines was
  139 and for the Ch&acirc;teauneuf du Pape 148; not a statistically significant difference. It 
  should also be noted that several tasters remarked on the similarity of the wines;
  in spite of that the overall agreement was very strong, with the Kendall W coefficient
  of concordance 0.3757, the probability of that occurring by chance being only 0.0037.
  
  It should also be said that we were drinking a single  
  producer, single cuv&eacute;e Gigondas (Cuv&eacute;e Florence). This raises the observation 
  that if one has the opportunity to buy premium Gigondas wines, one might be wise to 
  consider it a preferred alternative to Ch&acirc;teauneuf do Pape if the price is right, as is likely
  to be the case. Note that the C&ocirc;te du Rh&ocirc;ne appellation is the largest production
  in France and the Gigondas and the Chateauneuf du Pape are the two best subappelations. Therefore
  it is not surprising that these wines are both very good examples of the southern Rh&ocirc;ne.
                                                                      
  It should be also noted that wine B was a negociant wine from the Perrin family.
  
  As far as the vintages are concerned, the rank sums for the two vintages across the wines were
  
  					1995    74
					1998    61
					1999    74
					2003    79
					
  again not an overwhelming difference, with the possible exception of 1998.
  
  Our host designed a contest (in which he did not participate because of his knowledge of which 
  wine was the magnum) in which each of the contestants had to guess which wine was a Gigondas and 
  which was a Ch&acirc;teauneuf du Pape. Multiple winners were permitted; each person who guessed the identity
  of six or eight wines correctly (it is obvious that it is not possible to guess the identity of 
  exactly seven wines) was deemed a winner and was awarded a bottle of California wine. Now it is
  obvious that one might get quite a few wines right by guessing randomly; the probability distribution 
  of correct guesses under the hypothesis of random guessing is as follows: 					
  
  Number of correct guesses	    Probability
  
          0                      0.01429
	 1                      0
	 2                      0.22857
	 3                      0
	 4                      0.51429
	 5                      0
	 6                      0.22857
	 7                      0
	 8                      0.01429
		  
	So, under "random guessing," an outcome of 6 or 8 correct guesses has a probability of about 0.24,
	which was deemed sufficient to qualify someone as a winner. Two of the tasters achieved this result, 
	with everybody else identifying correctly five or fewer wines. Nobody guessed the identities of all 
	eight wines correctly.
