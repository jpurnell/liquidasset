<br>
Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the
judges which ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 
(no correlation):<br>
<br>
     W = 0.0820<br>
The probability that random chance could be responsible for this
correlation is rather large, 0.5121. Most analysts would say that 
unless this probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences
are not strongly related.
<br>
We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with
the group preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's
preferences are a perfect predictor of the group's preferences. 
A 0.0 means no correlation, while a -1.0 means that the taster has
the reverse ranking of the group.

the preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful
differentiation among the wines, they are separated by --------------------

 Comments:<br>
This was an interesting (and lots of fun) tasting of Barbarescos
from the the Produttori di Barbaresco.  These were the regular
bottlings (not reservas) in a vertical tasting, held in Torino
in the Villa Gualino after an ICER conference. The wines were 
purchased in Alba but it was not known what the storage was like. 
Many of us felt that the 1980 was oxidized, but since the wines
came from the same source, this was no doubt just bad luck.  Still,
better bottles may well exist.  Although fully mature, the wines
were still tannic (and typical of Barbaresco), but quite
delicious.  Most important, we did not feel that there were
really strong differences across the vintages (with the exception
of the possibly oxidized wine).  In fact, the wines were all
priced at around $36 per bottle.  All agreed these were very
good value wines, and far better than most French wines for value.
