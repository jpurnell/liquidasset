 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.0607
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.7872. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.
<br>
  1.   ........  1st place    Wine B is Ch. Clinet                        
  2.   ........  2nd place    Wine D is Ch. Mouton Rothschild             
  3.   tied for  3rd place    Wine F is Ch. La Mission Haut Brion         
  4.   tied for  3rd place    Wine E is Ch. Lafite Rothschild             
  5.   ........  5th place    Wine A is Ch. Margaux

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  2.4286. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.7872

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

COMMENT:

  The 1995 vintage was deemed a good but not great viuntage. The left bank    
  was slightly better. At 22 years of age these wines are all approachable a
  and should be at their peak for drinking, but one member of the group did 
  not think that they were as good as they should have been. One  taster 
  thought that they were austere and several others seemed to concur. There 
  were very little differences among the wines, which is a reason why we could 
  not tell them apart.There was a debate in the group whether there would have been more       
  distinctiveness if they had been decanted earlier.
