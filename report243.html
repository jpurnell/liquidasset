<div class=body>Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):<br><br>    W = 0.0391<br><br>The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation is rather large,  0.9308. Most analysts would say that unless this probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly related.<br><br>We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group preference.<br>A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a perfect predictor of the group's preferences.<br>A 0.0 means no correlation, while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group. This is measured by the correlation R.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering. The Friedman Chi-Square value is  1.875. The probability that this could happen by chance is  0.931.</div>
<div class=body>We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correlations that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.<br><br></div>
<div class=body>Pairwise Rank Correlations<br><br>Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.744 for significance at the 0.05 level, and must exceed  0.667 for significance at the 0.10 level.<br><br></div>

<div class=body>COMMENT:<br><br>Overall this was a marvelous tasting, in the garden of our host at a delightful 70 deg f. <br>The food served was a delight of French provincial cuisine.<br>This was a challenging vertical of Leoville Poyferre. The 2 most recent vintages were most preferred amongst the group although there was no significance between the wines. It once again reminds us how pleasurable mature Bordeaux is to enjoy and drink with food. It also reminded us that there are no ‘off’ vintages in most decades a tribute to wine making and global warming. <br><br>We would encourage individuals to open and enjoy these wines over the next 10 years. <br><br>As a final treat the host produced a magnificent pistachio dacquoise to celebrate 30 years of publishing the tastings on-line finish the event .</div>
