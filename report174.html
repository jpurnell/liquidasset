 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1101
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.5204. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine E is Almaviva 2003                     
  2.   tied for  2nd place    Wine D is Cheval des Andes 2008

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  6.1667. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.5204

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  It was an unusual tasting in that the votes against were virtually the    
  same for seven of the eight wines. While these wines were ostensibly      
  different in maker and country of origin, their differences were         
  disguised to some extent by their relative youth. These wines were very   
  drinkable and their tannins were much softer than wines of this age       
  in other regions. These wines are all very young, they are very           
  approachable, and they are all a great value. We hypothesized that        
  the cabernet content may have influenced the tasters' liking for the      
  wines, but we have no good evidence for this, since the bottles did not   
  always reveal these percentages. The tasting was an eye-p[ener for several of
  the tasters, since many of us were not too familiar with wines from Chile and 
  Argentina. The customary significance test finds no significant difference 
  between the Chilean and Argentinian wines.
