 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.1963
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is rather large, 0.2112. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is Alpine 2008

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  9.6190. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.2112

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.74 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.64 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  A memorable tasting indeed. Wonderful wines and companionship. The tasting was a comparison of two adjacent vineyards
  that had conmpletely different soils and different elevations. What characterizes these wines is that for California                                             
  in particular they are low alcohol, ranging between 12.4% and 13.3% with the Horseshoe being at the lower level of the range.
   The sum of the ranks for the ALPINE and HORSESHOE were identical suggesting that in the aggregate the wines from these two
   vineyards were equally well liked. The difference between the oldest and youngest vintages was not significant. These
   wines were noticeably distinguished New World Pinot Noirs. They had great balance and none of the wines showed any
   meningful aging. With between 8 and 15 years of age, they suggested that they will continue to drink well for another 5+
   years at least.
