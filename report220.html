 Here is a measure of the correlation in the preferences of the judges which
 ranges between 1.0 (perfect correlation) and 0.0 (no correlation):
<br>
     W = 0.2321
<br>
<br>
 The probability that random chance could be responsible for this correlation
 is quite small, 0.0982. Most analysts would say that unless this
 probability is less than 0.1, the judges' preferences are not strongly
 related.
 We now analyze how each taster's preferences are correlated with the group
 preference. A correlation of 1.0 means that the taster's preferences are a
 perfect predictor of the group's preferences. A 0.0 means no correlation,
 while a -1.0 means that the taster has the reverse ranking of the group.
 This is measured by the correlation R.

The wines were preferred by the judges in the following order. When the
preferences of the judges are strong enough to permit meaningful differentiation
among the wines, they are separated by -------------------- and are judged to be
significantly different.

  1.   ........  1st place    Wine D is 1994

   We now test whether the ranksums AS A WHOLE provide a significant ordering.
 The Friedman Chi-square value is  9.2857. The probability that this could
 happen by chance is 0.0982

   We now undertake a more detailed examination of the pair-wise rank correla-
tions that exist between pairs of judges. First, we present a table in which you
can find the correlation for any pair of judges, by finding one of the names in the
left hand margin and the other name on top of a column. A second table arranges
these correlations in descending order and marks which is significantly positive
significantly negative, or not significant. This may allow you to find clusters
of judges whose rankings were particularly similar or particularly dissimilar.

Correlations must exceed in absolute value  0.89 for significance at the 0.05   
level and must exceed  0.83 for significance at the 0.1 level

 COMMENT:

  The present tasting is very similar to the one held in January 2019: the only difference is that our 
  host could not duplicate the 2007 Musar. It was replace by the 1998 Musar; hence five of the six 
  wines were idsntical in the two tastings. The basic purpose of the experiment was to assess the
  intertemporal consistency of the choices made by the group. It should also be noted that one person present
  in January was replaced by a different taster; thus seven of the eight tasters were identical. The Spearman
  rho rank correlation between the two sets of results (truncated to five) turns out to be -0.32; the question
  of statistical significance does not even arise since the two sets of rankings are negative correlated,
  which is certainly a disappointing result. This is driven predominantly by tghe ranks assigned to the
  2001 Musar which was highly rated in January but dead last in November.
  
  Within the November tasting the results were much more consistent: five of the tasters ranked the 1994 first,
  (although one taster ranked it last). The wines were all pleasurable to drink, even the ones not ranked
  highly.
